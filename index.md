<div class="intro">
  <p>Here is the bulk of my creative work from 2002 onwards. I hope everyone enjoys it, has a laugh, and connects with life in the best kind of ways. Hopefully this work endures throughout time in the brighter corners of the internet.<br>
  So without further adieuâ€¦<br>

<div class="section">
  <div class="text">
    <h2><a href="URL1">MIXTAPES</a></h2>
    <p>Custom blends, edits, and remixes that are re-ordered and trimmed, often with new sounds. Some tracks are built around a sample or song. Something for everyone: lofi, hip hop, instrumentals, film based, mainstream, underground, radio mixes, and remixes.</p>

    <h2><a href="URL2">MUSIC VIDEOS</a></h2>
    <p>An eclectic mix of music videos with a splash of anime.</p>

  <div class="text">
    <h2><a href="URL3">BAGAN HIP HOP PRODUCTION</a></h2>
    <p>Original beats, rhymes, and samples (I make no money from these - with good reason!). My rap persona, Bagan, is a soft spoken gentleman who enjoys himself too much and is a superspy when it comes down to it.</p>

    <h2><a href="URL4">J GUITAR LIBRARY</a></h2>
    <p>Composed demos from over the years. Not a complete set and I use these to pitch to potential band mates. Hopefully my songwriting improves each time. Beachy vibes.</p>

  <div class="text">
    <h2><a href="URL5">FILM</a></h2>
    <p>Films where I had different roles such as editor, videographer, photographer, actor, and VO guy. Quite the variety and difficult to describe.

  <div class="text">
    <h2><a href="URL6">RANDOM SHORTS</a></h2>
    <p>Last but not least. Snippets and experimental features including the illustrious Library Guy meme collection that has been in the vault for centuries (well, since 2022).</p>
