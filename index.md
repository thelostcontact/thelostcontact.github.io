<div class="intro">
  <p>Here is the bulk of my creative work from 2002 onwards. I hope everyone has a laugh and connects with life in the best of ways. Hopefully this work endures after I dodge a phaser blast and head into the chasm of the unknown.<br>
  So without further adieuâ€¦<br>
  Broadcasting from beyond: <strong style="color:#6eaaff"><a href="https://thelostcontact.github.io/" style="color:#6eaaff; text-decoration: none;">THE LOST CONTACT</a></strong>.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://thelostcontact.github.io/mixtapes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIXTAPES</a></h2>
    <p>Custom blends, edits, and remixes that are re-ordered and trimmed, often with new sounds. Some tracks are built around a sample or song. Something for everyone: lofi, hip hop, instrumentals, film based, mainstream, underground, radio mixes, and remixes.</p>
