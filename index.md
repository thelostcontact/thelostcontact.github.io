<div class="intro">
  <p>Here is the bulk of my creative work from 2002 onwards. I hope everyone has a laugh and connects with life in the best of ways. Hopefully this work endures after I dodge a phaser blast and head into the chasm of the unknown.<br>
  So without further adieuâ€¦<br>

    <h2><a href="https://thelostcontact.github.io/mixtapes/">MIXTAPES</a></h2>
    <p>Custom blends, edits, and remixes that are re-ordered and trimmed, often with new sounds. Some tracks are built around a sample or song. Something for everyone: lofi, hip hop, instrumentals, film based, mainstream, underground, radio mixes, and remixes.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://thelostcontact.github.io/bagan/">BAGAN HIP HOP PRODUCTION</a></h2>
    <p>Original beats and rhymes forged from samples (I make no money from these - with good reason!). My rap persona, Bagan, is a soft spoken charming gentleman who enjoys himself too much and is a superspy when it comes down to it.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://thelostcontact.github.io/jguitar/">J GUITAR LIBRARY</a></h2>
    <p>Composed demos from over the years. Not a complete set and I use these to pitch to potential band mates. Hopefully my songwriting improves each time. Beachy vibes.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://thelostcontact.github.io/film/">FILM</a></h2>
    <p>Films where I had different roles such as editor, videographer, photographer, actor, and VO guy. Quite the variety and difficult to describe.</p>
