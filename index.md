# 🛰️ [THE LOST CONTACT](https://thelostcontact.github.io/)

Here is the bulk of my creative work from 2002 onwards. I hope everyone has a laugh and connects with life in the best of ways. Hopefully this work endures after I dodge a phaser blast and head into the chasm of the unknown.  
So without further adieu…  
Broadcasting from beyond: **THE LOST CONTACT**.

## 🎤 BAGAN HIP HOP PRODUCTION

Original beats and rhymes forged from samples (I make no money from these — with good reason!).  
Bagan is a soft-spoken charming gentleman who enjoys himself too much and is a superspy when it comes down to it.

## 🎸 J GUITAR LIBRARY

Composed demos from over the years — not a complete set.  
I use these to pitch to potential band mates. Hopefully my songwriting improves each time.

## 🎥 FILM

Projects where I had different roles: editor, videographer, photographer, actor, and VO guy. Quite the variety.
