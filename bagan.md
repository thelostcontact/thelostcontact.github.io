# 🎤 Bagan Hip Hop Production

Welcome to my hip hop archive — a timeline of original tracks and albums I've produced under the name *Bagan*. This collection represents three distinct eras of creative growth, each with its own energy, style, and learning curve. Some tracks are raw and spontaneous, while others were layered over weeks of exploration.

I worked solo on all these projects: writing lyrics, producing beats, recording, and mixing. Every album is a snapshot of where I was at the time — creatively, emotionally, and personally.

> 🔊 **Tip:** For best sound quality, download the albums using the **MEGASYNC folder links**. You can also preview them on **YouTube** if you're just browsing.
