# 🎤 Bagan Hip Hop Production

Welcome to a timeline of tracks and albums I've produced under the stage name *Bagan*. Making Bagan tracks is mostly for my own enjoyment. I used to play these tracks for friends while driving around.

Unique to Bagan is a slower rap flow that typically focuses on a narrative of some sort (Bagan is here, he's there, he's in a dream, he's in the sea etc.). As Bagan uses a lot of slow rhymes and pauses, it might not even be considered rapping or even good rapping. Bagan exists in a fantasy land of sorts, away from certain hip hop content and conventions while embracing other conventions to the max for comedic effect. Bagan's work can also be dark, explicit, or surreal at times.

I hope you have a good laugh and appreciate any insights that come your way. As a character, Bagan is someone I'll probably re-invent at some point.   

> 🔊 **Tip:** For best sound quality, download the albums using the **MEGASYNC folder links**. You can also preview them on **YouTube** if you're just browsing.

## 🔥 The Bagan Albums

| Year | Name | Thumbnail | Description | Links |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **2007–2010** | Bagan Style | ![Bagan Style](https://via.placeholder.com/80x80.png?text=2007–2010) | Produced in Winnipeg and Toronto, these are Bagan's earliest tracks. Comedic, raw, and unfiltered, many of the beats were made manually without a drum machine, hence their quality. Rhymes were improvised or freestyled in a number of takes with pops on the mic. All in all, it is the beginning of Bagan, and the exploration of his style.| <a href="https://youtu.be/AcSF6BUJC5g" target="_blank">▶️ YouTube</a><br><a href="https://mega.nz/folder/mtIxyC6Y#3fdqsJMIaipYeHryo3zGUA" target="_blank">📥 Download Folder</a> |
| **2011–2014** | Bagan The Next Generation | ![Next Gen](https://via.placeholder.com/80x80.png?text=2011–2014) | The quality goes up a notch as more tracks were made with drum machines and there's less mic pops. Maybe Bagan's rapping improves? Maybe? Some tracks, like Machinima in Bagan's Tub, are from my days at Ryerson, and a lot are done in Asia or when I'm in between places. There are some great samples in there that hopefully can be revisited sometime. | <a href="https://youtu.be/DKIDSCJfZ3Y" target="_blank">▶️ YouTube</a><br><a href="https://mega.nz/folder/CowBzIJR#bll9vCV6hpiSqrcDXtU41g" target="_blank">📥 Download Folder</a> |
| **2015–2017** | Bagan Air | ![Bagan Air](https://via.placeholder.com/80x80.png?text=2015–2017) |  A lot of the tracks were made in Asia or in between (e.g., Bagan Air was produced in the air). It's a step up in terms of production and some lyrics were written beforehand (e.g., Little B and MK Bear). Little B has the best rapping and Lone Piano is my favourite in terms of production. Dark City is one I made during in my cave of a basement apartment in Taipei and one of my esoteric favourites. Less comedic than others, Bagan Air is about life's challenges, pitfalls, and upgrades.  | <a href="https://youtu.be/LhQsktGmCoc" target="_blank">▶️ YouTube</a><br><a href="https://mega.nz/folder/Ct5kEBgC#B2MQI44h68D0sKd5hqB-dQ" target="_blank">📥 Download Folder</a> |
