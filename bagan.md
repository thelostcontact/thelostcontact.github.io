# 🎤 Bagan Hip Hop Production

Welcome to my original hip hop archive — a timeline of tracks and albums I've produced under the stage name *Bagan*. In addition to my love of hip hop (all 10% of it - the rest is garbage), making Bagan tracks is mostly for my own enjoyment. I used to play these tracks for friends while driving around in Winnipeg and for people I met on my travels.

Every album is a snapshot of where I was at the time. Unique to Bagan is a slower rap flow that typically focuses on a narrative of some sort (Bagan is here, he's there, he's in a dream, he's in the sea etc.). As Bagan uses a lot of slow rhymes and pauses, it might not even be considered rapping or even good rapping. Bagan exists in a fantasy land of sorts, somewhat away from typical hip hop content and conventions while poking fun at those very things. Some content can also be a bit explicit, dark, spiritual, or fantastic at times.  

If you can get into it, I hope you have a good laugh and appreciate whatever insights come your way. As a character, Bagan is probably someone I'll come back to and re-invent at some point.

## 🔥 The Bagan Albums

| Year | Name | Thumbnail | Description | Links |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **2007–2010** | Bagan Style | ![Bagan Style](https://via.placeholder.com/80x80.png?text=2007–2010) | Bagan's earliest tracks that were produced in Winnipeg and Toronto. Comedic, raw, and unfiltered. Many of the beats were manually made without a drum machine (hence their quaity). Rhymes were improvised or freestyled in a number of takes. All in all, it is the beginning of Bagan, and the exploration of his style. I still enjoy listening to these from time to time as a certain magic, quality, and humour is there. | <a href="https://youtu.be/AcSF6BUJC5g" target="_blank">▶️ YouTube</a><br><a href="https://mega.nz/folder/mtIxyC6Y#3fdqsJMIaipYeHryo3zGUA" target="_blank">📥 Download Folder</a> |
| **2011–2014** | Bagan The Next Generation | ![Next Gen](https://via.placeholder.com/80x80.png?text=2011–2014) | The quality goes up a small notch as more tracks were made with drum machines. Maybe Bagan's rapping improves? Maybe? Some tracks, like Machinima in Bagan's Tub, are from my days at Ryerson, but a lot are done in Asia or when I'm in between places. There are some great samples there that hopefully can be revisited. | <a href="https://youtu.be/DKIDSCJfZ3Y" target="_blank">▶️ YouTube</a><br><a href="https://mega.nz/folder/CowBzIJR#bll9vCV6hpiSqrcDXtU41g" target="_blank">📥 Download Folder</a> |
| **2015–2017** | Bagan Air | ![Bagan Air](https://via.placeholder.com/80x80.png?text=2015–2017) |  A lot of the tracks were made while travelling around Asia and the vibe of the record might reflect that (e.g., Bagan Air was produced on an overseas flight). The album is a step up in terms of production and rapping, with some tracks written beforehand. Little B probably has the best rapping in there; Lone Piano is one of my favourites in terms of production. Perhaps less comedic than others, this one is more about our paths in life and its challenges, pitfalls, and upgrades.  | <a href="https://youtu.be/LhQsktGmCoc" target="_blank">▶️ YouTube</a><br><a href="https://mega.nz/folder/Ct5kEBgC#B2MQI44h68D0sKd5hqB-dQ" target="_blank">📥 Download Folder</a> |
