# 🎤 Bagan Hip Hop Production

Welcome to a timeline of tracks and albums I've produced under the stage name *Bagan*. Producing Bagan tracks is for my own enjoyment and I used to play these tracks for friends and travellers.

Unique to Bagan is a slower rap flow that typically focuses on a narrative of some sort (Bagan is here, he's there, he's in a dream, he's in the sea etc.). As Bagan uses a lot of slow rhymes and pauses, it might not even be considered rapping or even good rapping. It's more about narrative, comedy, and atmosphere than anything. Bagan exists in a fantasy land of sorts, away from certain hip hop conventions while embracing other conventions to the max. Tracks can also be dark, explicit, and surreal at times.

I hope you have a good laugh and appreciate any insights that come your way. As a character, Bagan is someone I'll probably re-invent at some point.   

> 🔊 **Tip:** For best sound quality, download the albums using the **MEGASYNC folder links**. You can also preview them on **YouTube** if you're just browsing.

## 🔥 Albums

| Year | Name | Description | Links |
|------|------|-------------|-------|
| **2007–2010** | **Bagan Style** | Produced in Winnipeg and Toronto, these are Bagan's earliest tracks. Comedic, raw, and unfiltered, many of the beats were made manually without a drum machine, hence their quality. Rhymes were freestyled in a number of takes with pops on the mic. All in all, it is the beginning of Bagan, and the exploration of his style. | <a href="https://youtu.be/AcSF6BUJC5g" target="_blank">▶️ YouTube</a><br><a href="https://mega.nz/folder/mtIxyC6Y#3fdqsJMIaipYeHryo3zGUA" target="_blank">📥 Download Folder</a> |
| **2011–2014** | **Bagan The Next Generation** | The quality goes up a notch as more tracks were made with drum machines with less mic pops. Maybe Bagan's rapping improves? Maybe? Some tracks are from my days at Ryerson, and a lot are done in Asia or when I'm in between places. There are some great samples in there that hopefully can be revisited sometime. | <a href="https://youtu.be/DKIDSCJfZ3Y" target="_blank">▶️ YouTube</a><br><a href="https://mega.nz/folder/CowBzIJR#bll9vCV6hpiSqrcDXtU41g" target="_blank">📥 Download Folder</a> |
| **2015–2017** | **Bagan Air** | A lot of the tracks were made in Asia or in between (e.g., Bagan Air was produced in the air). It's a step up in terms of production and some lyrics were written beforehand (e.g., Little B and MK Bear). Little B has the best rapping and Lone Piano is my favourite in terms of production. Dark City Remix was made in my cave of a basement apartment in Taipei and one of my all round favourites. Less comedic than others, Bagan Air is about life's challenges, pitfalls, and upgrades. | <a href="https://youtu.be/LhQsktGmCoc" target="_blank">▶️ YouTube</a><br><a href="https://mega.nz/folder/Ct5kEBgC#B2MQI44h68D0sKd5hqB-dQ" target="_blank">📥 Download Folder</a> |
