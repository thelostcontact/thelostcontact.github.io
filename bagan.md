# 🎤 Bagan Hip Hop Production

Welcome to a timeline of tracks and albums I've produced under the stage name *Bagan*. Making Bagan tracks is mostly for my own enjoyment. I used to play these tracks for friends while driving around in Winnipeg and for people I met on my travels.

Every album is a snapshot of where I was at the time. Unique to Bagan is a slower rap flow that typically focuses on a narrative of some sort (Bagan is here, he's there, he's in a dream, he's in the sea etc.). As Bagan uses a lot of slow rhymes and pauses, it might not even be considered rapping or even good rapping. Bagan exists in a fantasy land of sorts, somewhat away from typical hip hop content and conventions while embracing certain conventions to the max. Bagan's content can be a bit dark, explicit, or surreal at times.  

If you can get into it, I hope you have a good laugh and appreciate any insights that come your way. As a character, Bagan is probably someone I'll re-invent at some point.

## 🔥 The Bagan Albums

| Year | Name | Thumbnail | Description | Links |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **2007–2010** | Bagan Style | ![Bagan Style](https://via.placeholder.com/80x80.png?text=2007–2010) | Produced in Winnipeg and Toronto, these are Bagan's earliest tracks. Comedic, raw, and unfiltered. Many of the beats were made manually without a drum machine, hence their quality. Rhymes were improvised or freestyled in a number of takes. All in all, it is the beginning of Bagan, and the exploration of his style. I still enjoy listening to these from time to time as there's a certain magic there. | <a href="https://youtu.be/AcSF6BUJC5g" target="_blank">▶️ YouTube</a><br><a href="https://mega.nz/folder/mtIxyC6Y#3fdqsJMIaipYeHryo3zGUA" target="_blank">📥 Download Folder</a> |
| **2011–2014** | Bagan The Next Generation | ![Next Gen](https://via.placeholder.com/80x80.png?text=2011–2014) | The quality goes up a notch as more tracks were made with drum machines. Maybe Bagan's rapping improves? Maybe? Some tracks, like Machinima in Bagan's Tub, are from my days at Ryerson, but a lot are done in Asia or when I'm in between places. There are some great samples in there that hopefully can be revisited. | <a href="https://youtu.be/DKIDSCJfZ3Y" target="_blank">▶️ YouTube</a><br><a href="https://mega.nz/folder/CowBzIJR#bll9vCV6hpiSqrcDXtU41g" target="_blank">📥 Download Folder</a> |
| **2015–2017** | Bagan Air | ![Bagan Air](https://via.placeholder.com/80x80.png?text=2015–2017) |  A lot of the tracks were made while travelling around Asia or in between (e.g., the track Bagan Air was produced on an overseas flight). It's a step up in terms of production and some lyrics were written beforehand (e.g., Little B and MK Bear). Little B has the best rapping in there and Lone Piano is my favourite in terms of production. Less comedic than others, this one is about life's challenges, pitfalls, and upgrades.  | <a href="https://youtu.be/LhQsktGmCoc" target="_blank">▶️ YouTube</a><br><a href="https://mega.nz/folder/Ct5kEBgC#B2MQI44h68D0sKd5hqB-dQ" target="_blank">📥 Download Folder</a> |
