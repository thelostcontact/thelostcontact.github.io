# 🎤 Bagan Hip Hop Production

Welcome to my hip hop archive — a timeline of original tracks and albums I've produced under the name *Bagan*. This collection represents three distinct eras of creative growth, each with its own energy, style, and learning curve. Some tracks are raw and spontaneous, while others were layered over weeks of exploration.

I worked solo on all these projects: writing lyrics, producing beats, recording, and mixing. Every album is a snapshot of where I was at the time — creatively, emotionally, and personally.

> 🔊 **Tip:** For best sound quality, download the albums using the **MEGASYNC folder links**. You can also preview them on **YouTube** if you're just browsing.

## 🔥 The Bagan Albums

| Year | Name | Thumbnail | Description | Links |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **2007–2010** | Bagan Style | ![Bagan Style](https://via.placeholder.com/80x80.png?text=2007–2010) | Bagan's earliest tracks. Comedic, raw, and unfiltered. Many of the beats were manually made without a drum machine, which is why they are rough. Most of the rhymes are improvised in a number of takes, as Bagan refused to consider writing down lyrics. All in all, it is the beginning of Bagan. I still enjoy listening to these from time to time as a creative magic, quality, and humour is still there to enjoy. Also, they bring me back to cruising around in Winnipeg as I'd sometimes play these for my friends and driving to beach.

| **2011–2014** | Bagan The Next Generation | ![Next Gen](https://via.placeholder.com/80x80.png?text=2011–2014) | More tracks made with drum machines so the quality goes up a small notch. Maybe Bagan's rapping improves? Maybe a bit? Some tracks, like Machinima in Bagan's Tub, are from my days at Ryerson, but a lot are done in Asia or when I'm in between in Canada. Hopefully one day I can do some more sophisticated producing with some of the samples there. | <a href="https://youtu.be/DKIDSCJfZ3Y" target="_blank">▶️ YouTube</a><br><a href="https://mega.nz/folder/CowBzIJR#bll9vCV6hpiSqrcDXtU41g" target="_blank">📥 Download Folder</a> |
| **2015–2017** | Bagan Air | ![Bagan Air](https://via.placeholder.com/80x80.png?text=2015–2017) | This one is an evolution in Bagan's production and rapping. A lot of these tracks are lyrically improvised, but are of a higher quality and some are written, which drives up the quality, at least for Bagan. A lot of the tracks were made while travelling and maybe the whole vibe of this record reflects that. | <a href="https://youtu.be/LhQsktGmCoc" target="_blank">▶️ YouTube</a><br><a href="https://mega.nz/folder/Ct5kEBgC#B2MQI44h68D0sKd5hqB-dQ" target="_blank">📥 Download Folder</a> |
