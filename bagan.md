# 🎤 Bagan Hip Hop Production

Welcome to my original hip hop archive — a timeline of tracks and albums I've produced under the stage name *Bagan*. In addition to my love of hip hop (well the 10% of it that is gold), making Bagan tracks is for my own comedic and creative enjoyment. I used to play these tracks for my friends who I drove around in Winnipeg and for people I met on my travels.

Every album is a snapshot of where I was at the time, whether in Canada or abroad. Unique to Bagan is a slower rap flow that typically focuses on a narrative of some sort (Bagan is here, he's there, he's in a dream, he's in the sea etc.). It might not even be considered rapping or good rapping, as Bagan uses a lot of slow rhymes and pauses - mostly for comedic effect and due to a lack of skill. Bagan exists in a fantasy land of sorts, away from typical hip hop content and conventions while poking fun, in an over-the-top way at those very things. *Warning* - some content is a bit explicit or dark. 

If you can get into it, Bagan and I hope you have a good laugh and appreciate whatever insights come your way. As a character, Bagan is probably someone I'll come back to and re-invent at some point when I get back to producing.

## 🔥 The Bagan Albums

| Year | Name | Thumbnail | Description | Links |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **2007–2010** | Bagan Style | ![Bagan Style](https://via.placeholder.com/80x80.png?text=2007–2010) | Bagan's earliest tracks, mostly produced in Winnipeg and Toronto. Comedic, raw, and unfiltered. Many of the beats were manually made without a drum machine. Rhymes were improvised or freestyled in a number of takes. All in all, it is the beginning of Bagan. I still enjoy listening to these from time to time as a creative magic, quality, and humour is there. | <a href="https://youtu.be/AcSF6BUJC5g" target="_blank">▶️ YouTube</a><br><a href="https://mega.nz/folder/mtIxyC6Y#3fdqsJMIaipYeHryo3zGUA" target="_blank">📥 Download Folder</a> |
| **2011–2014** | Bagan The Next Generation | ![Next Gen](https://via.placeholder.com/80x80.png?text=2011–2014) | The quality goes up a small notch as more tracks were made with drum machines. Maybe Bagan's rapping improves? Some tracks, like Machinima in Bagan's Tub, are from my days at Ryerson, but a lot are done in Asia or when I'm in between places. There are some great samples there that hopefully can be revisited. | <a href="https://youtu.be/DKIDSCJfZ3Y" target="_blank">▶️ YouTube</a><br><a href="https://mega.nz/folder/CowBzIJR#bll9vCV6hpiSqrcDXtU41g" target="_blank">📥 Download Folder</a> |
| **2015–2017** | Bagan Air | ![Bagan Air](https://via.placeholder.com/80x80.png?text=2015–2017) |  A lot of the tracks were made while travelling around Asia and maybe the whole vibe of this record reflects that (Bagan Air was produced while flying in an airplane). The album is a step up in terms of production and rapping, with some tracks written beforehand. Little B probably has the best rapping in there and Lone Piano is one of my favourites in terms of production. Perhaps less comedic than others, this one is more about life's spiritual journey and its challenges and pitfalls.  | <a href="https://youtu.be/LhQsktGmCoc" target="_blank">▶️ YouTube</a><br><a href="https://mega.nz/folder/Ct5kEBgC#B2MQI44h68D0sKd5hqB-dQ" target="_blank">📥 Download Folder</a> |
