# üé¨ Film Archive

Welcome to my personal archive of short films, multimedia projects, and experimental edits from over the years. These projects span a wide range of styles ‚Äî from action satire to moody portraits, student experiments to professional commissions.

Some were filmed with small crews, some cut from found footage, and some set entirely to music. Many projects reflect the gear I had access to and ideas that came to me at the time, often fantistical, comedic, or dark. Some include music I edited myself.

To experience these films:

- Use the **Download** link to get the highest quality `.mp4` or archive file via MEGA (no account required).
- Use the **Stream** link to watch instantly via YouTube or Vimeo.
- Many downloads are higher quality or contain alternate edits not available on streaming.

## üéûÔ∏è Film Projects

| Year | Title | Description | Links |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| **2008** | I am the Ninja (10th Anniversary Edition) | This was an assignment at Ryerson University starring Bert McKinley as the ninja his roommate Devon as the boss at the end. It was originally broken into 8 parts and attached to various locations on Google Earth. The track came first which inspired the visuals. The shops in there were my friend's parents' wrap shop and where I got my haircut. All the extras were friends and roommates at the time, whoever was around really. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/HlYCjYgJ#BMC9GENl_J-TrQZvOsePD4MAqTntVnsl-Hwaz3iLJuc){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://youtu.be/8bYPjB9vc_U){:target="_blank"} |
|  | A Dark Day | This is a short I directed from my EFP Video Production class at Ryerson back around 2009. It delves into the delusions of a madman named Crazy Beard before he meets his fate. Part of the assignment was to include interior/exterior transition shots and from different locations to one another. The score I produced mirrors one of my favourite films: Halloween (1978). | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/jgIURJoC#dR6mK5_RmKOhMlP-1fyvxI07jLeKncB4Sy9nkURUeKY){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://youtu.be/YNRSOv9N66Q){:target="_blank"} |
|  | Guitar Fighter | Done for a digital media class, this flash animation was originally two parts and was interactive, meaning you clicked on choices within and it would take you one way or another. I recorded the guitar parts and recruited my friend, Evan Webb to pose in there. The deer is from a picture I took in New Zealand back in 2005. I imagined Guitar Fighter could be a hilarious B-movie one day with guitar weilding ninjas and revenge. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/qxhQiQTQ#j_SGSA6fPTut-0TrXrG7YqcbEZ2RYhhrtLN-84vLyb0){:target="_blank"} |
|  | Wedding Music | I played bass guitar as part of a band for my friend's cousin's wedding on the outskirts of Winnipeg. It is not music I typically listen to or play. What made special was the the fun times we had preparing for it, playing live, and enjoying the reception it got.  | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/W4QxjDbZ#EOr2dOWFgXCsKwysFDMArHKmLv2i3l6tTGXDM-S3ogg){:target="_blank"} |
| **2009** | Butan Director's Cut | This was done for an EFP production class at Ryerson. It is a director's cut because the original was hastily edited before the deadline and wasn't great. I also made a funnier version, "Butan Extended Remix," which has goofy sound effects and is a bit longer. That "real" beard came in handy for a lot of videos around this time.  | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/TlJz1TKK#GEYQDnlQkHRPZU-ErjjCOMyF_ZmI9HIo_SHsfd2A-90){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://vimeo.com/7303668){:target="_blank"} |
|  | Butan Extended Remix | See the description above. Fun fact: the exterior shoot was in the Ryerson courtyard right outside the old recreation complex where I used to lifeguard. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/agpkwJiR#nypsf3HFTQydQ73PbOlN0h0dwJY9iHPLdwUI7KPn2sc){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://vimeo.com/7309175){:target="_blank"} |
|  | Nestor's Bass | This was another one for our EFP production class. Nestor, the guy playing bass, went on to play bass professionally in a Canadian punk rock band PUP (Pathetic Use of Potential) alongside my other Ryerson friend Stefan who is the singer. They are quite well-known and well-respected in Canada with new albums and videos in the mix.  | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/ntwiHaCA#g7T9HvvPLTsQrsReA6li9zlOiBjIJxxhuYGvT7wjJjQ){:target="_blank"} |
|  | Crime Feat. Andrew Wong | For our EFP production class, we were given a list of camera and lighting techniques to pull off. We chose the unifying theme of "crime."  | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/CwJwmL4D#fZvr6uKc_ODgdINyOH75q6H3DY8lwGNeHTyyIvYmsrg){:target="_blank"} |
| **2010** | Mirror | This was for my editing class at Ryerson and the footage is from a local news station. It covers the topic of male annorexia and bulemia. It was my final assignment and thought it turned out well. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/6xYyhR5T#RFofoj5XkrTppIUqFwzWaxaHAjHjyvg8a_CM3lwnoYA){:target="_blank"} |
|  | The Kitchen | Joey's makin an offering, it's stickin. . Escaped asylum patient "Joey" winds up at a party in Winnipeg. Still obessessed with collecting sacrifices, he continues on his twisted path, this time enchanting a kitchen to do his bidding. Who is going to stop him? Who knows... This was made in Winnipeg at my friend Alex's old apartment. It was all improvised and was an attempt to make a film while having a light party evening. I edited this one and the titles at the end were quite fun.| [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/HtBTiY5K#FCaHeI8XgmrMtuUHItKwWyPSflSKqiwkJWhBNrjTrTM){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://youtu.be/WdfJK_BK-Os){:target="_blank"} |
|  | The Human Project | This was my practicum project in my final year at Ryerson. I operated one of the cameras and did maybe 1/3 of the editing for it. Bert McKinley, who directed it, had a vision for a documentary series where people speak straight on into the camera about a unique life experience they've had. The first part of the film is about a guy who found a dead body and the rest are about scars. Stefan, the singer of PUP, recorded and mixed the sound for this. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/HtgzEBzZ#8IqNsU_FTRZ136BFH4A-pfDgO6yEaWm0RVNMDQRfDp4){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://vimeo.com/77850144){:target="_blank"} |
|  | Waterkeeper Demo | This was a documentary demo I put together at my internship at Mercury Films, a documentary film company in Toronto. I was there for around a month or two doing editing projects for them. I really appreciated the mentoring I got there and it was a culmination of everything I had learned at Ryerson. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/SpBx0D4B#Aud_A7SLmE2ayZNaEhR8EDh1BqCGcu8JesxESC4ToRs){:target="_blank"} |
| **2012** | Bright Future | This is a film I filmed during my travels in Asia in 2012. It was one of my dreams to backpack Asia for a year and I edited this while living in Hualien. The month in Hualen was a crossroads for me because I wanted to teach English again but wasn't sure whether to return to Korea or stay in Taiwan. Long story short, I ended up going back to Korea for 2 years. They were rougher years, but made some great friends along the way and it was a foundation for what was to come. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/6hQSzKLT#Q8Aab2IgyXjKYpJQl-Wj8EMrLFjb3PJzemfb5nUOU3c){:target="_blank"} |
| **2016** | Tainan, TAIWAN (3 Days & 2 Nights) | This is a video I did for one of my classes at NTUST business school in Taipei. My other group members did the content and I edited it into a video. The class took a trip to Tainan and we did our presentation with it there. In my group were three lovely colleagues who I was fortunate enough to have the company of touring around with. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/HhwD3awb#a8INc3SfqSaGSBmNplR_nfMWxq4N-_KOZFHgJ_S7rys){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://youtu.be/nu_YpHkOUfU){:target="_blank"} |
| **2017** | Grad Vid Taipei | This is an attempt to document my experience at business school at NTUST and some of my life in Taipei. It was a tough time but a wonderful one. Grateful for all the friends I made there and the transformation that happened in my life. The time in Taipei really pointed me to my life in Kaohsiung, which I will always be grateful for. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/a1ZAHDQD#KEzvu66vJwc6ePxkrmQlduGctG9eZHiYQ8jos7havy8){:target="_blank"} |
| **2020** | Taiwan Living Âè∞ÁÅ£ÁîüÊ¥ª | This was my life in Kaohsiung pre-Covid 19. It was mostly spent with Donna as we wined our dined, went into nature, and met new friends. I produced this shortly before going back to Canada in 2020, not knowing if I'd ever be back. Not without challenges, it was one of the most enjoyable periods in my life and I lived very simply in a room above a scooter shop. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/G4pCyZjT#ewOQHcZjVWrEo6OI3EJ1d-DrJKpWdSdaonU4CU7ye5w){:target="_blank"} |
| **2024** | Trek to the Beach - OrbRaider4K | Aerius, a teleporting traveller, tours around the universe searching for orbs, which would contain bits of wisdom, and clues to unwravelling a cosmic mystery. This was filmed at Secret Beach in Kaohsiung. The footage is right before a huge typhoon came and changed a lot of the forest and beach there. This was a rough experiment for a series and might be one to develop more in the future with an overarching story. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/npBwiDbK#7_wTMSX7xCAe4Qo1bR34XFelon3RwUIRL2TZ_QjANiY){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://youtu.be/kU7cM33-fOQ){:target="_blank"} |

## ‚ú® Bonus Archive ‚Äì SW Fan Edits

| Year | Title | Description | Links |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| **2013‚Äì2015** | SW Despecialized Editions | This is the original SW theatrical trilogy, restored to their original versions before they were "specialized" in the 1990s (all garbage in my opinion and the beginning of the decline of SW). This was a collaborative effort by a number of fan editors and a quick Google or GPT can give you some more information about them. My go-to versions of SW. | [üì• Download Folder](https://mega.nz/folder/uhJXCLRI#K76XJqOa6cMcYXeYLzg7AA){:target="_blank"} |
| **2024** | SW Jedi Scriptures Trilogy | These are fan edits of the prequil films and the Kenobi series I created in the summer of 2024. I wanted to focus mostly on the Jedi or spiritual elements of the films which are buried. "Phantom" is a 10 minutes version of the first film (enough said). The second film "Ulterior Motives," is a redux of another SW fan edit called SW Neon Noir. The idea was to take the good parts of Neon Noir and modify the rest, which included its overarching sound issues. Similarly, Kenobi, the third film, is a modified form of another fanedit called Obiwan Kenobi (based on a TV series). I took out everything I didn't like which mostly involved the villians and kid Leia to focus more on Kenobi and Vader. Stay until the end of the credits for a unique battle. Fun facts: Mixing the sound and exporting the final video files were the parts that took the longest and most brainpower. The actual editing down of the films took about a day or two each. | [üì• Download Folder](https://mega.nz/folder/4MRCzBpY#rFKrrx9uHxmT5TEbwXZfag){:target="_blank"} |
| **2006‚Äì2010** | SW Original Trilogy Documentaries | These are documentaries of the making of the original trilogy, all made by the same editor. They're well done and something different. It's difficult to find all three together online. | [üì• Download Folder](https://mega.nz/folder/BBAUzbiY#1QAHZqoIdv4vJGVcRINjtQ){:target="_blank"} |
