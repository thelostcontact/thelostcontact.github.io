# üé¨ Film Archive

Welcome to my archive of short films, multimedia projects, and experimental edits from over the years. These projects span a wide range of styles ‚Äî from action satire to moody portraits, student experiments to professional commissions.

Some were filmed with small crews, some cut from found footage, and some set entirely to music. Many projects reflect the gear I had and the ideas at the time. Some include music I edited myself.

## üéûÔ∏è Film Projects

| Year | Title | Description | Links |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| **2008** | I am the Ninja (10th Anniversary Edition) | This was an assignment at Ryerson University starring Bert McKinley as the zombie ninja. It was originally broken into 8 parts. I made the track first which inspired the the visuals. The shops used were my friend's parents' wrap shop and my barbershop in Toronto. All the extras were friends and roommates at the time. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/HlYCjYgJ#BMC9GENl_J-TrQZvOsePD4MAqTntVnsl-Hwaz3iLJuc){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://youtu.be/8bYPjB9vc_U){:target="_blank"} |
|  | A Dark Day | This is a short I directed from my EFP Video Production class at Ryerson. It delves into the delusions of a madman named Crazy Beard before he meets his fate. Part of the assignment was to include transition shots from different locations to one another. The score is inspired by Halloween (1978), one of my favourites. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/jgIURJoC#dR6mK5_RmKOhMlP-1fyvxI07jLeKncB4Sy9nkURUeKY){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://youtu.be/YNRSOv9N66Q){:target="_blank"} |
|  | Guitar Fighter | Done for a digital media class, this flash animation was originally two parts and was interactive. I recorded the guitar parts and recruited my dormatory friend at the time, Evan, to help out. The deer is from a picture I took in New Zealand back in 2005. I imagined Guitar Fighter could be a hilarious B-movie one day. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/qxhQiQTQ#j_SGSA6fPTut-0TrXrG7YqcbEZ2RYhhrtLN-84vLyb0){:target="_blank"} |
|  | Wedding Music | I played bass guitar for a wedding on the outskirts of Winnipeg. The music is not music I typically listen to or play. The band included a few of my Winnipeg buddies: Alex Edye (drummer and metal warlord), Kevin Roy (singer and solo artist), and Jonathan Epp (guitarist and diamond dealer). Before practice, we'd fire up the N64 and play MK Trilogy, a frantic thrillride. Epp would greet me in his Gollum voice with "Shire... Baggins..."  | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/W4QxjDbZ#EOr2dOWFgXCsKwysFDMArHKmLv2i3l6tTGXDM-S3ogg){:target="_blank"} |
| **2009** | Butan Director's Cut | This was done for an EFP production class at Ryerson. It is a director's cut because the original was hastily edited before the deadline (i.e., hot garbage). I also made a funnier version, "Butan Extended Remix" (see below). The "real" beard came in handy for many things around this time. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/TlJz1TKK#GEYQDnlQkHRPZU-ErjjCOMyF_ZmI9HIo_SHsfd2A-90){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://vimeo.com/7303668){:target="_blank"} |
|  | Butan Extended Remix | I had some extra footage and stumbled on some hilarious SFX so figured, "why not?" | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/agpkwJiR#nypsf3HFTQydQ73PbOlN0h0dwJY9iHPLdwUI7KPn2sc){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://vimeo.com/7309175){:target="_blank"} |
|  | Nestor's Bass | This was for our EFP production class. Nestor, the guy playing bass, went on to play bass professionally in a Canadian band called PUP (Pathetic Use of Potential) alongside my Ryerson friend Stefan who is the singer. PUP is quite well-known in the Canadian punk scene. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/ntwiHaCA#g7T9HvvPLTsQrsReA6li9zlOiBjIJxxhuYGvT7wjJjQ){:target="_blank"} |
|  | Crime Feat. Andrew Wong | Andrew Wong and I were given a list of camera and lighting techniques to pull off for our EFP production class. We chose "crime" as a theme. I recently added in the opening and final title.| [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/CwJwmL4D#fZvr6uKc_ODgdINyOH75q6H3DY8lwGNeHTyyIvYmsrg){:target="_blank"} |
| **2010** | Mirror | The footage is from a local news station in Toronto and was for the final exam of my video editing class. The short covers the topic of male annorexia and bulemia. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/6xYyhR5T#RFofoj5XkrTppIUqFwzWaxaHAjHjyvg8a_CM3lwnoYA){:target="_blank"} |
|  | The Kitchen | "Joey's makin an offering, it's stickin..." Escaped asylum patient "Joey" winds up at a party in Winnipeg. Still obessessed with collecting human sacrifices, he continues on his twisted path, enchanting the kitchen to do his bidding. Who is going to stop him? Who knows... This was made at Alex Edye's old apartment in Winnipeg. It was an attempt to improvise a film in the midst of a party. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/HtBTiY5K#FCaHeI8XgmrMtuUHItKwWyPSflSKqiwkJWhBNrjTrTM){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://youtu.be/WdfJK_BK-Os){:target="_blank"} |
|  | The Human Project | This was for practicum at Ryerson. Bert McKinley and Erin Sproule had a vision for a doc series where people speak directly into the camera about unique life experiences. The first part of the film is about a guy who found a dead body at Niagara Falls and the rest are about scars. Stefan, mentioned above, recorded and mixed the sound. The film won excellence in film directing, editing, and sound design at Toronto Youth Shorts in 2010. Working on this is a cherished memory and the fulfillment of a dream. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/HtgzEBzZ#8IqNsU_FTRZ136BFH4A-pfDgO6yEaWm0RVNMDQRfDp4){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://vimeo.com/77850144){:target="_blank"} |
|  | Waterkeeper Demo | This was a documentary demo I put together at my internship at Mercury Films in Toronto. I was there for around a month or two doing editing small projects. I appreciated the mentoring I receieved from Nick and it was a culmination of everything I had learned. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/SpBx0D4B#Aud_A7SLmE2ayZNaEhR8EDh1BqCGcu8JesxESC4ToRs){:target="_blank"} |
| **2012** | Bright Future | I filmed this during my Asia travels in 2012 and spent a month editing it in Hualien, Taiwan. I was at a crossroads and ended up going back to Korea to teach at an elementary school for 2 years in Busan. Come to think of it, I could have just stayed in Taiwan to save time. However, I made some great friends, had many adventures, and Korea Part 2 laid the foundation in my life for what is now. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/6hQSzKLT#Q8Aab2IgyXjKYpJQl-Wj8EMrLFjb3PJzemfb5nUOU3c){:target="_blank"} |
| **2016** | Tainan, TAIWAN (3 Days & 2 Nights) | This is a video I did for one of my classes at NTUST business school in Taipei. My other group members produced the content and I edited the video. The class took a trip to Tainan and we did our presentation there. I was fortunate enough to have the company of three lovely colleagues to tour around with. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/HhwD3awb#a8INc3SfqSaGSBmNplR_nfMWxq4N-_KOZFHgJ_S7rys){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://youtu.be/nu_YpHkOUfU){:target="_blank"} |
| **2017** | Grad Vid Taipei | The aim was to document my business school and some of my life in Taipei at the time. I'm grateful for the friends I made; for meditations at the centre with monk Gen Tonglam; and for mystical experiences and changes in my apartment cave. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/a1ZAHDQD#KEzvu66vJwc6ePxkrmQlduGctG9eZHiYQ8jos7havy8){:target="_blank"} |
| **2020** | Taiwan Living Âè∞ÁÅ£ÁîüÊ¥ª | This was my life in Kaohsiung from 2017-2020 before returning to Canada during Covid 19. Donna entered the picture and it chonicles the bright side of life here. When I produced this in 2020, I didn't know if I'd ever be back. Not without its challenges, it was one of the most enjoyable periods. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/G4pCyZjT#ewOQHcZjVWrEo6OI3EJ1d-DrJKpWdSdaonU4CU7ye5w){:target="_blank"} |
| **2024** | Trek to the Beach - OrbRaider4K | This was a rough experiment for a Youtube series. Aerius, a teleporting traveller, tours around the universe searching for orbs, which contain clues to unwravelling the cosmos. Filmed at Secret Beach, the footage is right before a massive typhoon which changed a lot of the nature. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/npBwiDbK#7_wTMSX7xCAe4Qo1bR34XFelon3RwUIRL2TZ_QjANiY){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://youtu.be/kU7cM33-fOQ){:target="_blank"} |

## ‚ú® Bonus Archive ‚Äì SW Fan Edits

| Year | Title | Description | Links |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| **2013‚Äì2015** | SW Despecialized Editions | The original SW theatrical trilogy - restored to their original versions before they were "specialized" in the 1990s. This was a collaborative effort by a number of fan editors and visual artists. These are my go-to versions of the original trilogy. | [üì• Download Folder](https://mega.nz/folder/uhJXCLRI#K76XJqOa6cMcYXeYLzg7AA){:target="_blank"} |
| **2024** | SW Jedi Scriptures Trilogy | These are fanedits I did of the SW prequel films and the Kenobi TV series. "Phantom" is a 10 minute version of the first film. "Ulterior Motives," is a redux of another SW fan edit called Neon Noir and condenses the second and third films. Kenobi Legends is a redux of another fan edit called Obiwan Kenobi (stay until the end of the credits for an easter egg). The most intensive parts of making these were mixing the sound and exporting the final video files which seemed to take forever to get right. | [üì• Download Folder](https://mega.nz/folder/4MRCzBpY#rFKrrx9uHxmT5TEbwXZfag){:target="_blank"} |
| **2006‚Äì2010** | SW Original Trilogy Documentaries | These are documentaries of the making of the original SW trilogy. All three were made by the same editor and are difficult to find online. They're something different and quite well done. | [üì• Download Folder](https://mega.nz/folder/BBAUzbiY#1QAHZqoIdv4vJGVcRINjtQ){:target="_blank"} |
