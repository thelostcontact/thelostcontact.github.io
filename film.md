## üéûÔ∏è Film Projects

| Year | Title | Description | Links |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| **2008** | I am the Ninja (10th Anniversary Edition) | This was an assignment at Ryerson University starring Bert McKinley as the ninja his roommate Devon as the boss at the end. It was originally broken into 8 parts and attached to various locations on Google Earth. The track came first which inspired the visuals. The shops in there were my friend's parents' wrap shop and where I got my haircut in Toronto. All the extras were friends and roommates at the time. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/HlYCjYgJ#BMC9GENl_J-TrQZvOsePD4MAqTntVnsl-Hwaz3iLJuc){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://youtu.be/8bYPjB9vc_U){:target="_blank"} |
|  | A Dark Day | This is a short I directed from my EFP Video Production class at Ryerson. It delves into the delusions of a madman named Crazy Beard before he meets his fate. Part of the assignment was to include transition shots from different locations to one another. The score I produced is inspired by one of my favourite films: Halloween (1978). | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/jgIURJoC#dR6mK5_RmKOhMlP-1fyvxI07jLeKncB4Sy9nkURUeKY){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://youtu.be/YNRSOv9N66Q){:target="_blank"} |
|  | Guitar Fighter | Done for a digital media class, this flash animation was originally two parts and was interactive. I recorded the guitar parts and recruited my friend, Evan Webb to help out. The deer is from a picture I took in New Zealand back in 2005. I imagined Guitar Fighter could be a hilarious B-movie one day with guitar weilding ninjas and revenge. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/qxhQiQTQ#j_SGSA6fPTut-0TrXrG7YqcbEZ2RYhhrtLN-84vLyb0){:target="_blank"} |
|  | Wedding Music | I played bass guitar for a wedding on the outskirts of Winnipeg. The music is not music I typically listen to or play. This was done with some of my Winnipeg buddies: Alex Edye (drummer - one of the best), Kevin Kratch (singer - now Kevin Roy), and Jonathan Epp (guitarist - heart of diamonds). We had quite a lot of fun preparing, playing live, and enjoying people dancing. One day I will wield the bass once more.  | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/W4QxjDbZ#EOr2dOWFgXCsKwysFDMArHKmLv2i3l6tTGXDM-S3ogg){:target="_blank"} |
| **2009** | Butan Director's Cut | This was done for an EFP production class at Ryerson. It is a director's cut because the original was hastily edited before the deadline. I also made a funnier version, "Butan Extended Remix," which has goofy sound effects and is a bit longer. The "real" beard used in the video came in handy for a lot of projects around this time. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/TlJz1TKK#GEYQDnlQkHRPZU-ErjjCOMyF_ZmI9HIo_SHsfd2A-90){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://vimeo.com/7303668){:target="_blank"} |
|  | Butan Extended Remix | This is the remixed version from the description above. The exterior shots were done in the Ryerson courtyard right outside where I used to lifeguard. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/agpkwJiR#nypsf3HFTQydQ73PbOlN0h0dwJY9iHPLdwUI7KPn2sc){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://vimeo.com/7309175){:target="_blank"} |
|  | Nestor's Bass | This was also for our EFP production class. Nestor, the guy playing bass, went on to play bass professionally in a Canadian punk rock band PUP (Pathetic Use of Potential) alongside my other Ryerson friend Stefan who is the singer. They are quite well-known in the Canadian punk scene and have been nominated for several awards.  | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/ntwiHaCA#g7T9HvvPLTsQrsReA6li9zlOiBjIJxxhuYGvT7wjJjQ){:target="_blank"} |
|  | Crime Feat. Andrew Wong | For our EFP production class, we were given a list of camera and lighting techniques to pull off. We chose the unifying theme of "crime."  | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/CwJwmL4D#fZvr6uKc_ODgdINyOH75q6H3DY8lwGNeHTyyIvYmsrg){:target="_blank"} |
| **2010** | Mirror | This was for my editing class at Ryerson and the footage is from a local news station. It covers the topic of male annorexia and bulemia. It was my final assignment and thought it turned out well. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/6xYyhR5T#RFofoj5XkrTppIUqFwzWaxaHAjHjyvg8a_CM3lwnoYA){:target="_blank"} |
|  | The Kitchen | Joey's makin an offering, it's stickin. . Escaped asylum patient "Joey" winds up at a party in Winnipeg. Still obessessed with collecting human sacrifices, he continues on his twisted path, enchanting a kitchen to do his bidding. Who is going to stop him? Who knows... This was made at my friend Alex's old apartment in Winnipeg. It was an attempt to improvise a film while having a light evening party. I produced the final cut, the music, and the titles at the end.| [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/HtBTiY5K#FCaHeI8XgmrMtuUHItKwWyPSflSKqiwkJWhBNrjTrTM){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://youtu.be/WdfJK_BK-Os){:target="_blank"} |
|  | The Human Project | This was my practicum project at Ryerson. I was one of the videographers and editors. Our director and producer, Bert McKinley and Erin Sproule, had a vision for a documentary series where people speak directly into the camera about a unique life experiences. The first part of the film is about a guy who found a dead body at Niagara Falls and the rest are about scars. Stefan, the singer of PUP, was part of our student team and recorded and mixed the sound. It won excellence in film directing, editing, and sound design at the Toronto Youth Shorts in 2010. It is the fulfillment of a dream to be part of a film like this and one of my cherished experiences. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/HtgzEBzZ#8IqNsU_FTRZ136BFH4A-pfDgO6yEaWm0RVNMDQRfDp4){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://vimeo.com/77850144){:target="_blank"} |
|  | Waterkeeper Demo | This was a documentary demo I put together at my internship at Mercury Films, a documentary film company in Toronto. I was there for around a month or two doing editing small projects for them. I really appreciated the mentoring I got there and it was a culmination of everything I had learned about broadcasting and filmmaking. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/SpBx0D4B#Aud_A7SLmE2ayZNaEhR8EDh1BqCGcu8JesxESC4ToRs){:target="_blank"} |
| **2012** | Bright Future | I filmed this during my travels in Asia in 2012. It was one of my dreams to backpack Asia for a year and I edited this in Hualien, Taiwan for a month. While editing it, I was at a crossroads because I wanted to teach English again but wasn't sure whether to return to Korea or stay in Taiwan. Long story short, I went back to Korea for 2 years to teach elementary school after a semester in Busan learning Korean. Perhaps I could have bypassed the years and stayed in Taiwan but I made some great friends along the way and it laid a foundation for what was to come. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/6hQSzKLT#Q8Aab2IgyXjKYpJQl-Wj8EMrLFjb3PJzemfb5nUOU3c){:target="_blank"} |
| **2016** | Tainan, TAIWAN (3 Days & 2 Nights) | This is a video I did for one of my classes at NTUST business school in Taipei. My other group members produced the content and I edited the video. The class took a trip to Tainan and we did our presentation with it there. In my group were three lovely colleagues who I was fortunate enough to have the company of touring around with. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/HhwD3awb#a8INc3SfqSaGSBmNplR_nfMWxq4N-_KOZFHgJ_S7rys){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://youtu.be/nu_YpHkOUfU){:target="_blank"} |
| **2017** | Grad Vid Taipei | This is an attempt to document my experience at business school in Taipei and some of my life there. I'm grateful for all the friends I made there, adventures in meditation, and the transformation I experienced. The time in Taipei pointed me to my life in Kaohsiung and new beginnings. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/a1ZAHDQD#KEzvu66vJwc6ePxkrmQlduGctG9eZHiYQ8jos7havy8){:target="_blank"} |
| **2020** | Taiwan Living Âè∞ÁÅ£ÁîüÊ¥ª | This was my life in Kaohsiung before and during Covid 19 before I returned to Canada (2017-2020). Donna entered the picture and it chonicles the local city, nature, food, and some friends. When I produced this in 2020, I didn't know if I'd ever be back so it is more a reminder for me than anything. Not without its challenges, it was one of the most enjoyable periods in my life. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/G4pCyZjT#ewOQHcZjVWrEo6OI3EJ1d-DrJKpWdSdaonU4CU7ye5w){:target="_blank"} |
| **2024** | Trek to the Beach - OrbRaider4K | This was a rough experiment for a Youtube series. Aerius, a teleporting traveller, tours around the universe searching for orbs, which contain bits of wisdom, and clues to unwravelling the mystery of the cosmos. Filmed at Secret Beach in Kaohsiung, the footage is right before a massive typhoon which changed a lot of the nature there. I might return to this one and develop it more.  | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/npBwiDbK#7_wTMSX7xCAe4Qo1bR34XFelon3RwUIRL2TZ_QjANiY){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://youtu.be/kU7cM33-fOQ){:target="_blank"} |

## ‚ú® Bonus Archive ‚Äì SW Fan Edits

| Year | Title | Description | Links |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| **2013‚Äì2015** | SW Despecialized Editions | The original SW theatrical trilogy - restored to their original versions before they were "specialized" in the 1990s (all garbage in my opinion - the beginning of the decline of SW). This was a collaborative effort by a number of fan editors and a quick search can give you some more information about them. These are my go-to versions. | [üì• Download Folder](https://mega.nz/folder/uhJXCLRI#K76XJqOa6cMcYXeYLzg7AA){:target="_blank"} |
| **2024** | SW Jedi Scriptures Trilogy | These is a fanedit trilogy I did of the SW prequil films and the Kenobi series that focus on the mystical elements. "Phantom" is a 10 minutes version of the first film. The second film, "Ulterior Motives," is a redux of another SW fan edit called SW Neon Noir. Kenobi Legends, the third film, is a redux of another fan edit called Obiwan Kenobi. Stay until the end of the credits with this one. The editing of the films and narratives took about a day or two each. The most intensive parts were mixing the sound and exporting the final video files which seemed to take forever to figure out. | [üì• Download Folder](https://mega.nz/folder/4MRCzBpY#rFKrrx9uHxmT5TEbwXZfag){:target="_blank"} |
| **2006‚Äì2010** | SW Original Trilogy Documentaries | These are documentaries of the making of the original trilogy, all made by the same editor. It's difficult to find all three together online. They're quite well done and something different. | [üì• Download Folder](https://mega.nz/folder/BBAUzbiY#1QAHZqoIdv4vJGVcRINjtQ){:target="_blank"} |
