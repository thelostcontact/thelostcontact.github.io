# üé¨ Film Archive

Welcome to my personal archive of short films, multimedia projects, and experimental edits from over the years. These projects span a wide range of styles ‚Äî from action satire to moody portraits, student experiments to professional commissions.

Some were filmed with small crews or solo, some cut from found footage, and some set entirely to music. Many projects reflect the gear I had access to, the stories I needed to tell, and the themes that captivated me at the time ‚Äî identity, urbanity, absurdity, and the human connection.

Some include music I edited myself or were scored afterward. Others were crafted purely to experiment with rhythm, montage, or emotion through moving images.  

To experience these films:

- Use the **Download** link to get the highest quality `.mp4` or archive file via MEGA (no account required).
- Use the **Stream** link to watch instantly via YouTube or Vimeo.
- Many downloads are higher quality or contain alternate edits not available on streaming.

> üìΩÔ∏è **Tip:** Watch with headphones when possible. Many of these are designed to sync audio and visual cues closely.

## üéûÔ∏è Film Projects

| Year | Title | Description | Links |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| **2008** | I am the Ninja (10th Anniversary Edition) | Filmed in Toronto and before I knew how to use drum machines. It was an assignment at Ryerson University starring Bert McKinley as the ninja. Originally broken into 8 parts.| [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/HlYCjYgJ#BMC9GENl_J-TrQZvOsePD4MAqTntVnsl-Hwaz3iLJuc){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://youtu.be/8bYPjB9vc_U){:target="_blank"} |
|  | A Dark Day | This is a short I directed from my EFP Video Production class at Ryerson University (currently Toronto Metropolitan University) back around 2009. It delves into the delusions of a madman named Crazy Beard before he meets his fate. There was a list of elements we had to achieve including exterior/interior transition shots and from different locations to one another. I also produced the eerie score and edited it. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/jgIURJoC#dR6mK5_RmKOhMlP-1fyvxI07jLeKncB4Sy9nkURUeKY){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://youtu.be/YNRSOv9N66Q){:target="_blank"} |
|  | Guitar Fighter | This flash animation was originally two parts and was interactive, meaning you clicked choices and it would take you one way or another. It was done for a Digital Media class and I recorded the guitar parts and recruited my friend, Evan Webb, to be the other guys. The deer is from a picture I took in New Zealand back in 2005. I imagined Guitar Fighter could be a hilarious B-movie one day with guitar weilding ninjas and masters. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/qxhQiQTQ#j_SGSA6fPTut-0TrXrG7YqcbEZ2RYhhrtLN-84vLyb0){:target="_blank"} |
|  | Wedding Music | I played bass guitar as part of a band for a wedding for my friend Jon's cousin, Jeremy. It was quite fun and not really music I typically listen to or play. What made it quite special was the reception it got and the fun times we had as a group preparing for it.  | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/W4QxjDbZ#EOr2dOWFgXCsKwysFDMArHKmLv2i3l6tTGXDM-S3ogg){:target="_blank"} |
| **2009** | Butan Director's Cut | This was done for an EFP production class at Ryerson with Lucia Wong and Andrew Wong. It is a director's cut because the original was hastily edited before the deadline and wasn't the best it could be. I took some time and made this version and a funnier version, "Butan Extended Remix," which has goofy sound effects and is a bit longer. Glad I could make use of that beard for a lot of videos around this time.  | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/TlJz1TKK#GEYQDnlQkHRPZU-ErjjCOMyF_ZmI9HIo_SHsfd2A-90){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://vimeo.com/7303668){:target="_blank"} |
|  | Butan Extended Remix | See the description for "Butan Director's Cut" above. Fun fact: the exterior shoot was in the Ryerson courtyard right outside the old recreation complex where I used to lifeguard. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/agpkwJiR#nypsf3HFTQydQ73PbOlN0h0dwJY9iHPLdwUI7KPn2sc){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://vimeo.com/7309175){:target="_blank"} |
|  | Nestor's Bass | This was another one for our EFP production class. Fun fact: Nestor, the guy playing bass, went on to play bass professionally in a Canadian punk rock band PUP (Pathetic Use of Potential) alongside my other Ryerson friend Stefan who is the singer. They are quite well-known and well-respected in Canada, especially in the indie and punk communities.  | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/ntwiHaCA#g7T9HvvPLTsQrsReA6li9zlOiBjIJxxhuYGvT7wjJjQ){:target="_blank"} |
|  | Crime Feat. Andrew Wong | Another EFP production one where we were given a list of camera and lighting techniques to pull off. We chose the unifying theme of "crime" which was fun. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/CwJwmL4D#fZvr6uKc_ODgdINyOH75q6H3DY8lwGNeHTyyIvYmsrg){:target="_blank"} |
| **2010** | Mirror | This was for my editing class at Ryerson and the footage is from a local news station. It covers the topic of male annorexia and bulemia. It was my final assignment and thought it turned out well. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/6xYyhR5T#RFofoj5XkrTppIUqFwzWaxaHAjHjyvg8a_CM3lwnoYA){:target="_blank"} |
|  | The Kitchen | Joey's makin an offering, it's stickin. . Escaped asylum patient "Joey" winds up at a party in Winnipeg. Still obessessed with collecting sacrifices for his master, he continues on his twisted path, this time enchanting a kitchen to do his bidding. Who is going to stop him? Who knows? -> Shot in Winnipeg at my friend Alex's old apartment many years ago. It was an attempt to make a film while partying and is all improvised. The titles at the end were a fun project for me and are worth taking the time for | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/HtBTiY5K#FCaHeI8XgmrMtuUHItKwWyPSflSKqiwkJWhBNrjTrTM){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://youtu.be/WdfJK_BK-Os){:target="_blank"} |
|  | The Human Project | This was my practicum project in my final year at Ryerson. I operated one of the cameras and did maybe 1/3 of the editing for it. Bert McKinley, who directed it, had a vision for a documentary series where people speak straight on into the camera about a unique life experience they've had. The first part of the film is about a guy who found a dead body and the rest are about scars. Stefan, currently in PUP mentioned above, recorded and mixed the sound for this. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/HtgzEBzZ#8IqNsU_FTRZ136BFH4A-pfDgO6yEaWm0RVNMDQRfDp4){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://vimeo.com/77850144){:target="_blank"} |
|  | Waterkeeper Demo | This was a documentary demo I put together at my internship at Mercury Films, a documentary film company in Toronto. It was a wonderful job and was there for 1-3 months doing editing projects for them. I really appreciated the mentoring I got there and it was a culmination of everything I had learned during my broadcasting program at Ryerson. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/SpBx0D4B#Aud_A7SLmE2ayZNaEhR8EDh1BqCGcu8JesxESC4ToRs){:target="_blank"} |
| **2012** | Bright Future | This is film I put together while living for a month in Hualien, Taiwan, after a year of travels across Asia 2012. It was one of my dreams to backpack Asia for a year. That month was a crossroads for me because I wanted to teach English again but wasn't sure whether to return to Korea or perhaps stay in Taiwan. I had unfinished business in Korea so I went back there. Even though I live between Canada and Taiwan in the end, I'll never regret those 2 years back in Korea, as I made some great friends and had some hardships that eventually lead me to wonders. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/6hQSzKLT#Q8Aab2IgyXjKYpJQl-Wj8EMrLFjb3PJzemfb5nUOU3c){:target="_blank"} |
| **2016** | Tainan, TAIWAN (3 Days & 2 Nights) | This is a video I did for one of my classes at NTUST business school in Taipei. The others did the content mostly and I put it together, I think in one evening. The class took a trip to Tainan and I was fortunate in my group to have the company of three lovely colleagues to tour around with. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/HhwD3awb#a8INc3SfqSaGSBmNplR_nfMWxq4N-_KOZFHgJ_S7rys){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://youtu.be/nu_YpHkOUfU){:target="_blank"} |
| **2017** | Grad Vid Taipei | This is an attempt to document my experience at business school at NTUST and some of my life in Taipei for two years. It was a tough time but a wonderful one. Grateful for all the friends I made there and the transformation that happened in my life. The time in Taipei really pointed me to Kaohsiung, which I will always be grateful for. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/a1ZAHDQD#KEzvu66vJwc6ePxkrmQlduGctG9eZHiYQ8jos7havy8){:target="_blank"} |
| **2020** | Taiwan Living Âè∞ÁÅ£ÁîüÊ¥ª | Now we're onto Koahsiung and my life here pre-Covid 19. This was mostly spent with Donna as we wined our dined our way around town, went into nature, and met new friends. I produced this shortly before going back to Canada in 2020, not knowing if I'd ever be back. Not without challenges, it was one of the most enjoyable periods in my life and I lived very simply in a room above a scooter shop, sharing the kitchen and facilities with flatmates, really enjoying being free from responsibilities. It was the pivot towards everything the next stage in my career wise and me doing a vocation I'm proud of. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/G4pCyZjT#ewOQHcZjVWrEo6OI3EJ1d-DrJKpWdSdaonU4CU7ye5w){:target="_blank"} |
| **2024** | Trek to the Beach - OrbRaider4K | This is an idea I had for a Youtube channel. The main character would journey around searching for orbs, which would contain bits of wisdom, and clues to unwravelling a mystery about the universe and elder gods. This was filmed at Secret Beach in Kaohsiung and right before a huge typhoon came and changed a lot of the forest and beach there. This was rough experiment, to be honest but might be a good one to tweak a lot, and develop more in the future with an overarching story. | [üì• Download](https://mega.nz/file/npBwiDbK#7_wTMSX7xCAe4Qo1bR34XFelon3RwUIRL2TZ_QjANiY){:target="_blank"} <br> [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stream](https://youtu.be/kU7cM33-fOQ){:target="_blank"} |

## ‚ú® Bonus Archive ‚Äì SW Fan Edits

| Year | Title | Description | Links |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| **2013‚Äì2015** | SW Despecialized Editions | This is the original SW theatrical trilogy, restored to their original versions before they were "specialized" in the 1990s (all garbage in my opinion and the beginning of the decline of SW). This was a collaborative effort by a number of fan editors and a quick Google or GPT query can give you some more information about them. These are my go-to original trilogy versions. | [üì• Download Folder](https://mega.nz/folder/uhJXCLRI#K76XJqOa6cMcYXeYLzg7AA){:target="_blank"} |
| **2024** | SW Jedi Scriptures Trilogy | These are fan edits of the prequil films and the Kenobi series I created in the summer of 2024. I wanted to focus mostly on the Jedi or spiritual elements which are crux of SW for me. The first film is so void of meaning for me that I cut it down to 10 minutes and called it "Phantom." In this version, Anakin behaves like he's a kid, and might almost be admired. The second film "Ulterior Motives," is basically a redux of another SW fan edit called SW Neon Noir. The idea was to take the vision and good parts of Neon Noir and modify the rest (including its overarching sound issues). I put Kenobi Legends, the third film, together in around 2 days. Similar to what I did with Neon Noir, it is a modified form of another fanedit called Obiwan Kenobi. I took out everything I didn't like which mostly involved the villians and kid Leia to focus more on Kenobi and Vader. Stay until the end of the credits for a unique battle. Fun facts: Mixing the sound and exporting the final video files were the parts that took the longest and most brainpower. The actual editing down of the films was quite breezy and enjoyable. | [üì• Download Folder](https://mega.nz/folder/4MRCzBpY#rFKrrx9uHxmT5TEbwXZfag){:target="_blank"} |
| **2006‚Äì2010** | SW Original Trilogy Documentaries | These are documentaries of the making of the original trilogy, all made by the same editor, and are quite well done. They're something different and it's difficult to find all three online. | [üì• Download Folder](https://mega.nz/folder/BBAUzbiY#1QAHZqoIdv4vJGVcRINjtQ){:target="_blank"} |
