# 🎧 Mixtape Archive

Welcome to my mixtape collection — an evolving archive of handpicked tracks I've edited throughout the years. 

Typically, a mixtape takes 1-2 weeks in my spare time. This includes finding and curating tracks, cutting parts from tracks (e.g., verses/choruses, vocals, skits, SFX), re-ordering parts, adding SFX and dialogue, re-working beginnings and endings, and blending similar tracks together. Some tracks I've put together almost from scratch — getting beats, samples, and building from there. Some tracks are great as I find them. Once it's finished, I listen to the final tape over and over again until it's time to make another one.   

I've divided the tapes into 3 generations. The 3rd generation is my best work, the 2nd is great too, and the 1st has the least amount of editing. Each tape reflects a time in my life and they always bring me back. The best way to experience them is with a set of decent headphones or speakers and to set the song order to random, leaving the experience to chance.

Finally, there are tracks from specific films, TV, and games that I've copied from various mixtapes and organized into folders. This will save you time if you're looking for specific content (e.g., LOTR, Bond, SW etc.)

To experience the tapes:

- Click the **View Page** link for each generation to browse mixtape titles.
- Use the **Download Folder** link to grab each generation in full via MEGASYNC (no account required).
- If you encounter a MEGA folder with individual files, look at the top for a 'download' button to grab the whole folder at once.  

> 🔊 **Tip:** MEGA’s in-browser player is clunky sometimes, especially on phones — downloading the full mixtapes and files is the best way to listen seamlessly.
