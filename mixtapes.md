# ðŸŽ§ Mixtape Archive

Welcome to my mixtape collection â€” an evolving archive of handpicked tracks I've edited throughout the years. 

Typically, I sit down and create a mixtape for about a week in my spare time. With each track, I do whatever is needed to bring it to a new level. This includes cutting parts (e.g., verses/choruses, vocals, skits, SFX), re-ordering, adding SFX and dialogue, blending with other tracks, and re-working the beginnings and endings. Some tracks I've put together almost from scratch â€” getting beats, samples, and building from there. Some tracks are perfect as they are. After I make the final edits, I wait a week to listen to the finished product. Then I listen to the final tape over and over again until it's time to make another one.   

I've divided the tapes into 3 generations. The 3rd generation is my best work, 2nd is great too, and 1st is from a different age and has the least amount of editing. Each tape reflects a time in my life and they always bring me back. The best way to experience them is with a set of decent speakers or headphones and to set your player to random, leaving the experience to chance.

Finally, there are mixtape tracks from specific films, TV, and games that I've organized into folders. You can access them in labelled folders rather than digging through each mixtape. 

To experience the tapes:

- Click the **View Page** link for each generation to browse mixtape descriptions.
- Use the **Download Folder** link to grab each generation in full via MEGASYNC (no account required).
- If you encounter a MEGA folder with individual files, look at the top for a 'download' button to grab the whole folder at once.  

> ðŸ”Š **Tip:** MEGAâ€™s in-browser player is clunky sometimes, especially on phones â€” downloading the full mixtapes and files is the best way to listen seamlessly.
