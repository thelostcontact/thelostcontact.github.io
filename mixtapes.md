# 🎧 Mixtape Archive

Welcome to my mixtape collection — an evolving archive of handpicked tracks I've edited. 2-3 times per year I sit down and create a mixtape for about a week in my spare time. 

With each track, I do whatever is needed to bring it to a new level according to my vision. This includes cutting parts (e.g., verses/choruses, vocals, skits, SFX), re-ordering, adding SFX and skits, blending with other tracks, and re-working the beginnings and endings. Some tracks I've put together almost from scratch — getting beats, samples, and building from there. 

Some tracks arrive perfectly so I include them as is. After I listen to the whole tape and make final edits, I wait a week to listen to the finished product. Then I listen to the final tape over and over again until it's time to make another one.   

I've divided the tapes into 3 generations. The 3rd generation is my best work to check out first, 2nd is great too, and 1st is from a different age  and has the least amount of editing on my part. Each tape reflects a time in my life and they always bring me back. The best way to experience each one is with a set of decent speakers or headphones and to set your player to random, leaving the experience to chance.

Finally, there are mixtape tracks from specific films, TV, and games that I've organized into folders for sake of convenience. You can access them in labelled folders rather than digging through each mixtape. 

To experience the tapes:

- Click the **View Page** link for each generation to browse mixtape descriptions.
- Use the **Download Folder** link to grab each generation in full via MEGASYNC (no account required).
- If you encounter a MEGA folder with individual files, look at the top for a 'download' button to grab the whole folder at once.  

> 🔊 **Tip:** MEGA’s in-browser player is clunky sometimes, especially on phones — downloading the files is the best way to listen seamlessly.

## 🌟 Featured Mixtape Generations

| **2020–2025** | ![Gen 3](https://via.placeholder.com/80x80.png?text=Gen+3) | **Gen 3** My best curating and mixing is here. Top tracks point to magic of the material and stories reimagined. It's difficult to pick a unique track I did, maybe Vader-Luke or Moonraker.    | [🔗 View Page](https://thelostcontact.github.io/mixtapes/gen3){:target="_blank"} <br> [📥 Download Folder](https://mega.nz/folder/e1hnyLxI#7Z_wneoul_DS1cuB6eKkOw){:target="_blank"} |
| **2010–2020** | ![Gen 2](https://via.placeholder.com/80x80.png?text=Gen+2) | **Gen 2** Playlists from a decade of travels, new friends, vocation prep, and adventures.

| **2000–2010** | ![Gen 1](https://via.placeholder.com/80x80.png?text=Gen+1) | **Gen 1** Early mixtapes from my highschool and university days in Winnipeg and Toronto. They are where I begin experimenting with curated mixtapes and tweaking tracks. These are from younger and more turbulent days, so perhaps they have a different and older feeling to them.| [🔗 View Page](https://thelostcontact.github.io/mixtapes/gen1){:target="_blank"} <br> [📥 Download Folder](https://mega.nz/folder/Tkw2lZpR#k3s1iv9QHDFZoRXwitI-JA){:target="_blank"} |
