# ðŸŽ§ The Lost Contact â€“ Mixtape Archive

Welcome to my mixtape collection. 2-3 times per year I sit down and create a mixtape for about a week in my spare time. It is an evolving archive of handpicked tracks I've edited. 

With each track, I do whatever is needed to bring it to a new level according to my vision for it. This includes cutting parts (e.g., verses/choruses, vocals, skits, SFX etc.), re-ordering it, adding SFX and skits, blending it with other tracks, and re-working the beginnings and endings. Some tracks I've put together almost from scratch - getting beats, samples, and building from there. 

Some tracks are so perfect, they don't need anything and I include them as is. If a track says EDIT beside it, it means I've done something to it. After I listen to the whole tape and make final edits, I wait a week to listen to the finished product. Then, typically, I listen to the perfected tape over and over again in my spare time until it's time to make another one.   

I've divided the mixtapes into 3 generations. Each generation reflects a period of time in my life and when I listen to a specific mixtape, it brings me back to life then. Finally, there are mixtape tracks from specific films, TV, and games that I've organized into folders for sake of conveniences. For example, if you're interested in LOTR, Star Wars, or Bond 007 tracks, you can access them there rather than digging through each mixtape. 

To experience the tapes:

- Click the **View Page** link for each generation to browse mixtape descriptions.
- Use the **Download Folder** link to grab the full collection as a `.zip` via MEGASYNC (no account required).
- Each mixtape folder includes MP3s for personal enjoyment. Best experienced with headphones.

> ðŸ”Š **Tip:** MEGAâ€™s in-browser player may glitch on phones â€” downloading the .zip is the best way to listen seamlessly.
