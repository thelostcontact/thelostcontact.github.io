# ðŸŽ¸ J Guitar Library

Welcome to my guitar-based instrumentals archive. These are compositions Iâ€™ve created over the years â€” melodic sketches and ambient guitar journeys recorded with minimal gear and maximum feeling.

Each track stands alone, but together they form a sonic diary of moods and movements. Some are upbeat and cinematic, others are dreamy or spacious. I let the guitar lead the way â€” and followed wherever it went.

To experience the library:

- Click the **ðŸŽ§ YouTube** link next to each track to listen.
- All links open in a new tab so you wonâ€™t lose your place.

> ðŸŽ§ **Tip:** Best enjoyed with headphones or in the background while writing, driving, or reflecting.
