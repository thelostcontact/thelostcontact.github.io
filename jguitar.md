# ðŸŽ¸ J Guitar Library

Welcome to my guitar-based instrumentals archive. This is a selection of compositions Iâ€™ve created over the years â€” melodic sketches recorded with minimal gear. I'm not sure how to describe them except for "beachy." 

Songwriting is one of those things that I focused on and practiced over time. Basically, a song will "arrive," as of sorts. I play something, tweak it, and it leads to something else, then something else. I play with the details, order, timing etc., and come out with a rough version, give or take a few sections. Then I record it and come back to it within a few days. I learned the hard way that if I don't record it, it will simply disappear. 

Lately, I've had to close myself off from creating new ones, as I'd like to play live and get out there. I have around 34 finished songs and I struggle to practice them all alongside new ones from May-June 2025. There are also some I need to relearn, quite good, that are just sitting there. 

Justin B was my name in elementary school as there was another Justin in the class. I started playing when I was a kid, around age 12, so maybe it is fitting name for this.

## ðŸŽ¼ Track Library

| Song Name | Description | Link |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| **Spaceship** | A ska tune and one of the trickiest for me to play as the parts have a lot nuances. I might come back to it to make it more enjoyable as I avoid practicing it. | <a href="https://youtu.be/QNKRSZWxMEQ" target="_blank">ðŸŽ§ YouTube</a> |
| **Snowstorm** | A faster one and one of the first I put together with more of an intricate order. 00:40 is one of my favourite verses to play. | <a href="https://youtu.be/NTPH-K12Bzc" target="_blank">ðŸŽ§ YouTube</a> |
| **Setting Out** | Catchy and could be the score to the beginning of an adventure. An enjoyable stroll in the middle before a push to the finish. | <a href="https://youtu.be/k_thBbxHJyE" target="_blank">ðŸŽ§ YouTube</a> |
| **Light / Dark** | One of my earlier songs I was proud of and I switched up the ending a few years ago. The original version you can here in the anime video. | <a href="https://youtu.be/IGEiQF20mUA" target="_blank">ðŸŽ§ YouTube</a> |
| **Far Away Dream** | This one is about following your dreams. It is an older one and I often play it in different styles and tempos. "You're not far away from your dream," are lyrics that come to mind during the final part. | <a href="https://youtu.be/6XLQR9l9paE" target="_blank">ðŸŽ§ YouTube</a> |
| **Chase & Get** | This is another remake of an older one that I made faster. I always imagine two people chasing one another, then with some close calls before the chase resumes.| <a href="https://youtu.be/sSm2jZrl3Ng" target="_blank">ðŸŽ§ YouTube</a> |
| **Blackout** | This was composed during an actual blackout in Kaohsiung. This is more of a slower punk rock one with a contemplative side to it.| <a href="https://youtu.be/vFfKUgHa2kU" target="_blank">ðŸŽ§ YouTube</a> |
| **Summer Always** | The second in a trilogy of songs that came out close together. This one is reminds me of a summer day that feels like it never ends; however, the day eventually winds down and everyone goes to sleep. | <a href="https://youtu.be/9q3H9Du1ot4" target="_blank">ðŸŽ§ YouTube</a> |
| **Ocean Swim** | This is one of my favourites to play, especially the heavier middle part, which was a good challenge to figure out. The first in the trilogy of songs I mentioned. Similar to swimming in the ocean, you can feel the force of the water at parts as a wave approaches. The last part is the sun going down in a magnificent vision. | <a href="https://youtu.be/5mw_AyPNcBI" target="_blank">ðŸŽ§ YouTube</a> |
| **Sunset Patio** | It's one of those songs that would be last on an album. I could play the ending all day if I could. One of my top 3. | <a href="https://youtu.be/Z1nmlRYeMsc" target="_blank">ðŸŽ§ YouTube</a> |
| **Night Beach** | The third in the trilogy of songs I mentioned. More of challenging one to play but highly enjoyable and rewarding to get right. | <a href="https://youtu.be/RGQ9eQTyPW4" target="_blank">ðŸŽ§ YouTube</a> |
