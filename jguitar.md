# ðŸŽ¸ J Guitar Library

Welcome to my guitar-based instrumentals archive. This is a selection of compositions Iâ€™ve created over the years â€” mostly rhythmic and melodic recorded with minimal gear. I'm not sure how to describe them except for "beachy." 

Songwriting is someething I focused on and practiced over time. Basically, a song will "arrive." I play something, tweak it, and it leads to something else, then something else. I play with the details, order, timing etc., and come out with a rough version, give or take. I then record it on my phone and come back to it. I learned the hard way that if I don't record it, it disappears and is gone for good. 

Lately, I've had to close myself off from new ones, as I'd like to play live and get out there. I have around 34 finished songs and I struggle to practice them all alongside new ones from May-June 2025. There are also some I need to relearn that are just sitting there. 

I started playing guitar when I was a kid, around age 13, and my parents got me lessons from a teacher named Dawin who came to our house on Queenston St. Dawin taught me about the guitar's versatility. We practiced 3-string jazz chords and rhythmic patterns which became useful in my songwriting.

## ðŸŽ¼ Track Library

| Song Name | Description | Link |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| **Spaceship** | A ska tune and one of the trickiest for me to play. I avoid practicing it so I might make it more enjoyable. | <a href="https://youtu.be/QNKRSZWxMEQ" target="_blank">ðŸŽ§ YouTube</a> |
| **Snowstorm** | A faster one and one of the first I put together with an intricate order. Around 00:40 is one of my favourite segments to play. | <a href="https://youtu.be/NTPH-K12Bzc" target="_blank">ðŸŽ§ YouTube</a> |
| **Setting Out** | This could be the score to an adventure. There's an enjoyable stroll in the middle before a push to the finish. | <a href="https://youtu.be/k_thBbxHJyE" target="_blank">ðŸŽ§ YouTube</a> |
| **Light / Dark** | One of my earlier songs and I changed the ending a few years ago. The original is in the music video with the same title and was played with a drummer and bass player. | <a href="https://youtu.be/IGEiQF20mUA" target="_blank">ðŸŽ§ YouTube</a> |
| **Far Away Dream** | This one is about living out dreams. It's an older one and I often play it in different styles and tempos. "You're not far away from your dream," are lyrics that come to mind during the final part. | <a href="https://youtu.be/6XLQR9l9paE" target="_blank">ðŸŽ§ YouTube</a> |
| **Chase & Get** | This is a remake of an older one that I made faster. I always imagine people chasing one another. There are close calls and someone almost gets caught before the chase resumes.| <a href="https://youtu.be/sSm2jZrl3Ng" target="_blank">ðŸŽ§ YouTube</a> |
| **Blackout** | There was a blackout in Kaohsiung one afternoon so I sat down and wrote this.| <a href="https://youtu.be/vFfKUgHa2kU" target="_blank">ðŸŽ§ YouTube</a> |
| **Summer Always** | The second song in a trilogy of songs that came out close together. This one is a summer day that feels like it never ends. | <a href="https://youtu.be/9q3H9Du1ot4" target="_blank">ðŸŽ§ YouTube</a> |
| **Ocean Swim** | This is the first in the trilogy of songs I mentioned. It is one of my favourites to play, especially the heavier part in the middle, which took me a while to figure out. I often swim in the ocean and certain parts remind me of the force of the water as a wave approaches. The last part is the sun going down in a magnificent vision. | <a href="https://youtu.be/5mw_AyPNcBI" target="_blank">ðŸŽ§ YouTube</a> |
| **Sunset Patio** | If I had an album, it might be the last song. There's an old Devo song I used to cruise to that that it reminds me of. I could play the ending all day. One of my top 3. | <a href="https://youtu.be/Z1nmlRYeMsc" target="_blank">ðŸŽ§ YouTube</a> |
| **Night Beach** | The third in the trilogy of songs I mentioned. It's an enjoyable challenge and rewarding to get right. | <a href="https://youtu.be/RGQ9eQTyPW4" target="_blank">ðŸŽ§ YouTube</a> |
