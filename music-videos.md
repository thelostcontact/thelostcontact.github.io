# üé• Music Video Archive

Welcome to my music video collection ‚Äî a personal timeline of experimental edits, animated sequences, and collaborative works that span nearly two decades. These projects were driven by inspiration, experimentation, and often built from scratch using editing software, game engines, animation tools, or remixing found footage. 

Some are standalone visual pieces; others accompany mixtape tracks or narrative ideas. These are for fun and for a love of editing.

|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| **2007** | Matt Renaud Dis | This was shot in the summer of 2007 in Winnipeg. Matt and Drew travelled Europe and sent me some hilarious email stories. It is one of the first tracks Bagan produced from scratch and rapped over. One does not know for sure if "Matt Renaud ain't got no flow" but you better watch the video and find out. . | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/MFJAHjia1NM) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/nhAG3QgS#zQZ0W4ChNMn3FpWaJuBAhlbh-LMJMkgoR5O-Hq-7Rlo) |
|  | Too Graphic - Bagan feat. Bert McKinley | This was produced for a class at Ryerson. Bert and I teamed up and I freestyled the track in one night producing two versions. Bert picked this one which lended itself to the visual style he had in mind. It got a laugh from the class and word went around the faculty. The best part was Bert quoting it randomly for the next few years. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/-nq6KfBSDaA) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/j0Yi0Q4T#qXEn75r6Vp2_5I3pjYTsck0LgA7cQugJvPTGS5pRZvg) |
| **2008** | Emporer in Japan | I found a trailor for Ran 1985. Ran is a visual masterpiece and operaic in a lot of ways - set in a distant time, almost in a realm of fantasy. The contrast between the lyrics and visuals, comedy aside, points to the delussional states that are common during chaos and collapse. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/eiC_HMy8WIQ) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/LspG0B6A#z209zbtNdD6oe2MRcZ-bheZqD_H7q6_6Rdw5pZRcLtk) |
|  | Machinima in Bagan's Tub | For a class at Ryerson, the course desription said the class would instruct us on how to use a green screen, which the professor completely ignored. Since I was determined to use a green screen, I came up with this which Bert helped me film. I got a B+, a laugh from the class, and made some new friends. It is one of my favourites. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/IA38pTEJ0gI) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/2lI1FZoa#4Pm4NLuo_WOluA5tS-AZDFFfgWoDywBwfiZa_VvCCog) |
| **2010** | Sniper Challengers (on Bald Mountain) | ***Warning*** explicit lyrics from the start. This was done at my shared flat in Toronto near "Hooker Harveys." I knew the sequence and music from watching Fantasia growing up. Pairing it with the track by 9th Prince was a turn-key. At the end, the harmony of darkness contrasts with the harmony of dawn where there is a surreal sense of having witnessed a dream. This era of Disney was more conceptual, evocative, and meaningful. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/a_jE38hMkq0) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/jgojCKgJ#QltrDj0FVx-ge_ciTDUcFaywgS9sO5DZ6Y_2UPpZv5k) |
|  | Godzilla vs. Bagan | I did this one in Winnipeg while staying at my mom's across from Grant Park. I noticed there was a character named Bagan that fights Godzilla. When I found the footage from the NES game, I was impressed by its visual style. The concept of two giant monsters meeting on a "dark stormy night" to brawl it out in the depths of a city is something I'll always love. The beat was one of my first with a drum machine and midi keyboard. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/zDveF7Zvw3s) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/nxBnGCDS#tfJZZmFzlw6BsygQL1B9CGzMaV3rCPGLVE0ncYBDOs8) |
|  | MAGNIFICENT | This was from a time in Toronto when I was watching a lot of famous Kung Fu films. This scene from the Magnificent Butcher 1979, caught my eye as the master in blue has particular grace. I needed to speed up the footage and movements as they were quite slow. In endless hip hop loops, the masters are in an eternal battle of wits. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/cnnnGOFf8uo) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/PxomnAzI#AoxkSwwhOdxOl8DzhGjvIoDr3pPAfEbyqMeL8CBV63Y) |
| **2011** | TNG (Part 1) | ***Warning*** Explicit lyrics near the end. I had just finished watching TNG and was working with samples from it. This one is purely for fun and I always enjoyed the comedic undertones in TNG. I thought the rolling bass and the deep space soundscape came out well. TNG part 2 instrumental on Bagan the Next Generation is also available if you like the style. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/yyheAVMS9oM) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/39IDgLDZ#JVtQzOPSVk8CBDHBrbDh2laga5x7ZilYQ7a_VJv8H5o) |
|  | The End of Time | This combines one of my favourite tracks by Ugly Duckling with images of the universe and earth. During my first teaching job in Korea, my personal PC was in my classroom, so I used to go there at night and edit. With this one, I didn't leave until the sun came up. In my life at the time, I was very concerned with time, rushing through the day mostly, and checking the clock constantly because I disliked my work. It's such a poor way to live really. The weekends were different, mostly for adventures, and found peace there. "Time means nothing: The end of time." | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/ERZx3MM4g-s) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/D0IWGLZR#NwdKltbBuMR4SB9dGzXHEBdszLSFcEzBpD0JOLrJLeU) |
|  | Bagan's on Your Train | I watched the Hitchcock film North by Northwest (1959) and Bagan felt compelled to freestyle. Bagan did the track first and I added the visuals. Originally, I said "in the 1960s" and had to re-record it months later to say, "in the 1950s" which is correct. The rap is a narrative that goes from start to finish. "Climbing down the rocks; getting sweaty socks," is a personal favourite in there. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/WVIUMtubPU8) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/GphmjATJ#B0eUbyDgKMQY2qM7ViGI-T8nkQDu38SFvNUnsNY7ty8) |
| **2012** | Freestyle Akuma | This one highlights my ongoing obsession with playing Ultra SFIV and its predecessors, something I've been doing since childhood. These days, I regularly beat Ultra SFIV on its hardest difficulty. Typically when I play, I turn the game music off and put on a mixtape. The flow that occurs is unmatched. I enjoy the nuances of Akuma who is a mysterious antihero who obsesses over strength, combat, and purity. Consumed by his path on the "dark side", there is still humanity in him - ruthless yet calm. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/3AnULadwXSQ) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/i9oHSQxT#ZLpd0Uof1rvXfHPlkurW28wG0zRN581KjGeFqzLiGcY) |
|  | Sewer Surfin | This is my tribute to TMNT, my favourite heros growing up. There was a time where I watched the first TMNT film every day for 72 days in a row (I remember counting). I've probably watched it well over 100 times (i.e., the film is a door into my psyche). I wanted to capture the different aspects of TMNT from the TV show, to the toys, to the Turtles in Time game, to the movies. Sci-fi, adventure, grit, mastery, brotherhood, and father/son dynamics are some of its themes. "Sewer Surfing" sort of says it all. How can surfing in the sewer be so awesome? | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/ye7gqa40iIQ) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/f4JVGYiC#Rpxs4s4jNp4ljTAuRLXvfxt0uix9m1CZ7zRrsCZgLbs) |
| **2013** | Shaolin Style | Another Kung Fu homage with the 36th Chamber of Shaolin (1978). The film carries Buddhist and Taoist undertones and explores the mythical side of training to be a Shaolin monk. The main character must learn from a range of masters who provide him with different teachings as he progresses. After he becomes more enlightened, he is faced with the realities of the world outside the temple and what to do with himself and his new abilities.  | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/0DNugFlLrBM) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/OlI0FBZa#oFG1P1n8Anq34dT8hTpnNqTDcAjzxkA72TMmVi9NNA0) |
|  | Busan a Lwan ‚Äî Bagan feat. Sai | I was studying Korean for a semester in Busan and Sai was a Burmese guy in my class. I filmed and edited his video and he rapped over my track Pleasure Garden. I'm in the video at the end, falling on the couch for a nap. I decided to make it like an old hip hop video which included a run down place, lots of camera movement, and fast cuts. Luckily my apartment was on a hill with a cool view of the city. Sai mostly raps in Burmese except for "mango chicken," for some reason, and drinks a glass of milk which I thought fits his juvenile look. His rap is about his confusion about a girlfriend he misses. Fun Fact: The apartment was demolished shortly after I moved. I once asked the landlord, a black American guy, who lived on the floor below if we could take sledge hammers and have fun smashing things. He had the deepest voice I ever heard and said, "No way man. Nooooo way."  | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/1JM42kyxBfQ) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/nwRBjaBQ#XCqeu32zh9YoDdqjGuys2K036EYsHKtOTizZ2uGdk3U) |
|  | Bagan's in the Sea | This is probably the laziest video I ever put together as it is one of Bagan's tracks overtop of a sequence I already had. Jill and I were on the island Ko Tao in Thailand learning how to scuba dive. If you see the pic at the end, there was a running joke with our Norweigan instructor (the guy on right) about the younger German guy (the guy on left) who was late for everything (Germans are notoriously known for being punctual). For one of our dives, the boat was literally leaving and he ran up the dock, half dressed, and leapt on. | [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/2hJFSazD#HuoBgN6eDXgG5IYZT2ZIojqKAr9ZMStdFAyeZLMXi6g) |
| **2014** | Lone Piano (Instrumental) | This one is an ode to fighting in anime. I wanted to capture the flow that occurs in different types of fighting sequences across different anime styles, characters, and universes. I spent hours scouring various anime mixes online to find the best clips. Musically, this is a track that I'm quite proud of.  | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/EAjc8oXW8Jw) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/P4pCyBTa#_3wG7ylXYWnPdJSgIKUY-8C5ZaxjLdgl2IAuChuI7dg) |
|  | A Drew Film (Bachelor's Mix) | My good friend Mr. Drew Fontaine had his bachelor's party and we went ziplining near Winnipeg. I had a sweet camera at the time so thought to document it and maybe turn it into a video. This one showcases my editing skill more than anything. It was fun making it seem like Drew was ziplining and yelling in the background for the majority of it. I also enjoyed mixing my friends' sounds and playing with the speed and direction of the clips. A fine day with fine gentlemen it was.   | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/9aQaeqdLwi4) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/mk5DDYTT#TR-KLqPpCmch8YCgvfPtUHOWAkawTKzIP4uFI08qXK4) |
| **2015** | Eyes May Shine | I found the breakdancing footage from Beat Street (1984) and added some underground tracks I like. The atmosphere of that club is timeless and admire the different characters and styles that appear. They were breaking to different music but there is a surreal quality to it all that lines up. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/KYCCb509xaQ) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/24YzDIBS#6nfOZ4VZJIIyqQjqUeEF4nuzP1NRRzSAo9IuixfDWLM) |
| **2016** | Dark City Trailer (Remix) | I liked the original Dark City's trailer so much that I took most of its sequences and cut them again using an HD version. The sample in the track is from "The Snowman," a Christmas animation from the 1980s. The film Dark City is about being in a dream, waking up, uncovering the truth, and changing the world. I had to put the project down for a while as I was stuck with a shot selection around around 00:52. Eventually, I settled on them in a boat (slow clap). There are a lot of opposing directions and movements in the juxtaposition which speaks to the film's themes and paradoxes. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/9mV3ltzganE) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/WkhFlBaR#xqNNo8gwAOmi0H_PivVO9RRJkfu8TobTUxVIAtaebYM) |
|  | BROOM | This is another one from Beat Street (1984) with a track from Yaggfu Front (1993). The unique style of dancing and the innocence of the characters really stands out. Like a lot of 80s pictures, Beat Street emphasizes having fun, making friends, and being light hearted in the face of challenges - an innocence and authenticity that seems to be missing from today's films. I had to showcase the guy in the sweater who is quite hilarious.  | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/oG8NO84tbZo) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/nhgj2Kgb#6ylBwkxU4XCvE3BJPj1luBMMbibryZP5Q0zESr5dNbg) |
|  | Vampire Iron | One of those moments where a track and pre-edited video line up with almost no editing required. When MF Doom says, "a dropping of a diamond," it shows a diamond ring dropping which is an editor's dream. The beginning and ending are a close up of a girl with a single tear, one of the great animated shots in my mind. When I originally watched the film, I had a premonition about the rocketship castle. It was that I would settle down in a place that would have something like this. The building isn't a rocketship to my knowledge, but the shape is almost the same.    | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/piP5OkE2vnI) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/K1g22ShZ#9SFSCb0mvODjqSzu-UXfQQ3v-6I-KurIcMe9KEz7u2g) |
|  | The Smoke | The intention was to capture what it might be like before we die, with memories and images flashing before our eyes. It's a reflection on living that often feels like it is through smoke with light permeating in the background. I produced it in a guesthouse in Bali, Indonesia and at the time, before bed would relax with a local spiced cigarette. There were deck chairs outside my door and I'd sit and watch the night and courtyard. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/7i_sArtHv6Y) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/e9RF2biD#7buAfS7SGY_Z7CQtFtqFv4zKIpaiDAJQpta78P7Gk5I) |
| **2017** | Light / Dark | The film is Ninja Scrolls (1993). I remembered the Ninja Scrolls blind swordsman and mimicked the sequence from that one. The song is one I composed and played with drummer James and bass player Lucas while I lived in Toronto. I jammed with James for around a year on and off. We held auditions for singers but none clicked. Fun story: the bassist, Lucas, disappeared into mosh pit at a metal concert in the middle of the night, and we never saw or heard from him again (he saw our texts but didn't reply). The end song by Canadian artists is from an animation called Cybersix. Toronto was a time of dabbling and revisiting the past but a dead end in terms of a future. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/Lknm0PgsOo4) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/WsA1TDpJ#XkvUNEwYWLEVr-AEcGuhq1axnGYsXdt52AcPGDaNruQ) |
| **2025** | Seaside Piano | This is from a recent journey to Taitung in 2024. It was one of those places near the sea to take photos. I thought the piano was cool so Donna got the video. I proceeded to accidently break one of 3 tire swings nearby - ouch! After searching Stevie Wonder and rock piano solos, I finally found a track from a video game that matched my dancing and sliding of hands. Fun fact about how Youtube works: this one got 1.4k views in just 9 days; 1k more that a lot of my vids from 17 years ago! | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtube.com/shorts/xejFGhKlu1E) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/ekwREJ4C#dsbLLzkobQDgS5n7LbgDBWEyCPhMNo8-ClOitoggEOY) |
|  | Wedding Day | ***Warning*** Explicit lyrics in there. This was Donna and I's marriage registration day which I keep private. The track is one of my all time favourites: Recognize Realize Part 2 -Mobb Deep- produced by Havoc. I found some relevant anime clips that resemble Kaohsiung and Donna so it all came together. The video reminds me about how awesome the day was. We went from the government office, to a brunch, to a walk around Cijin island, to free deck chairs, to a Sunset Bar for a rib dinner on the beach. It was just for us and very casual. It also celebrated a culmination of my dreams coming to fruitition. It is a reminder of the gift of life, Donna, and the many joys I get to live out each day.  | [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/etZlmCiR#Zyd3-pf3nQrov-uY3WIELUwgu6-VLILYC1gCZZscnhc) |
