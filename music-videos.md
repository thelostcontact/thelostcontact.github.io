# üé• Music Video Archive

Welcome to my music video collection ‚Äî a personal timeline of experimental edits, animated sequences, and collaborative works that span nearly two decades. These projects were driven by inspiration, experimentation, and often built from scratch using editing software, game engines, animation tools, or remixing found footage. 

Some are standalone visual pieces; others accompany mixtape tracks or narrative ideas. They each reflect a creative moment in time ‚Äî sometimes spontaneous, sometimes meticulously crafted. No matter the approach, these videos represent my evolving visual language and editing style.

These are purely for fun and for a love of editing. As you can tell, I'm not a visual artist by any means; however, there is joy to mixing together different content and creating something.

| **2007** | Matt Renaud Dis | This was shot in the summer of 2007 in Winnipeg. My buddies Matt and Drew travelled Europe recently and there were some hilarious email stories. It is one of the first tracks I produced from scratch and rapped over. One does not know for sure if "Matt Renaud ain't got no flow" but you better watch the video and find out. . | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/MFJAHjia1NM) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/nhAG3QgS#zQZ0W4ChNMn3FpWaJuBAhlbh-LMJMkgoR5O-Hq-7Rlo) |
|  | Too Graphic \| Bagan feat. Bert McKinley | This was produced for a class at Ryerson, digital media or something which is not my forte. Bert and I teamed up and I did the track in 1 night with 2 vocal versions, all freestyled. Bert picked this version which lended itself to visuals better. It got a laugh from the class and got around to my colleagues for about a week or so. The best was Bert (who laughs like Beastly from Care Bears) quoting it randomly for the next few years. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/-nq6KfBSDaA) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/j0Yi0Q4T#qXEn75r6Vp2_5I3pjYTsck0LgA7cQugJvPTGS5pRZvg) |
| **2008** | Emporer in Japan | I was into watching Akira Kurasawa films at that time I found a trailor for Ran 1985 and was inspired to freestyle a rhyme about being the emporer. The contrast between the lyrics and visuals points to the delussion certain leaders might have when their reign and kingdom is obviously falling. Notice it's "in Japan" not "of Japan," which points to the fleeting and limited power of such leaders in reality. The film itself is a visual classic and operaic in a lot of ways - set in a kingdom, in a distant time, in a realm of fantasy in many ways. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/eiC_HMy8WIQ) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/LspG0B6A#z209zbtNdD6oe2MRcZ-bheZqD_H7q6_6Rdw5pZRcLtk) |
|  | Machinima in Bagan's Tub | This was done for a class at Ryerson. The course desription said it included how to use a greenscreen, the reason I took the course, which the professor completely ignored. There was no green screen work. Since I was determined to use a greenscreen, this is the best I could come up with. I think I got a B or B+, got a laugh from the class, and made some new friends in the process.  One of my favourites from this collection. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/IA38pTEJ0gI) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/2lI1FZoa#4Pm4NLuo_WOluA5tS-AZDFFfgWoDywBwfiZa_VvCCog) |
| **2010** | Sniper Challengers (on Bald Mountain) | ***Warning*** explicit lyrics from the start. Done at my shared flat near "Hooker Harveys" in Toronto, there was something so raw and dark about the track that lended itself to the Night on Bald Mountain and the film's visuals. I knew the sample from watching the Fantasia sequence growing up. Watching it right to the end is quite worth it. There is a surreal sense of having witnessed a dream or a hidden side to things and light gradually appearing, putting it back in its place. It also points to an era of Disney where its work was more conceptual and evocative.    | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/a_jE38hMkq0) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/jgojCKgJ#QltrDj0FVx-ge_ciTDUcFaywgS9sO5DZ6Y_2UPpZv5k) |
|  | Godzilla vs. Bagan | I did this one in Winnipeg while staying with my mom at her apartment across from Grant Park. I noticed there was a character named Bagan that fights Godzilla, so searched and found the visuals originally from a NES game. I was impressed by the imagination of the visual style. Even with graphics that are unimpressive by today's standards, they were able to draw me in and to suspend my disbelief. I also love the idea of two giant monsters meeting on a "dark stormy night" to brawl it out in the depths of a city. The beat was one of my first with a drum machine and midi keyboard. Apart from the SFX, there was no samples used.| [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/zDveF7Zvw3s) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/nxBnGCDS#tfJZZmFzlw6BsygQL1B9CGzMaV3rCPGLVE0ncYBDOs8) |
|  | MAGNIFICENT | This was from a time in Toronto when I was watching a lot of famous Kung Fu films. This scene, from the Magnificent Butcher 1979, caught my eye as the master in blue has a particular grace and zenlike quality to his movements. The track was on a playlist I was listening to at the time which also has the sort of feeling beneath it. Due to the availability of the film at the time, the quality is what it is. A lot of the footage I needed to speed up as the actual movements in the film were quite slow. The ending loops back to repeat footage already shown. I think in addition to pointing to looping in hip hop itself, gives a sense of these two masters (one good, one evil) eternally battling it out, trying to out-wit one another.  | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/cnnnGOFf8uo) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/PxomnAzI#AoxkSwwhOdxOl8DzhGjvIoDr3pPAfEbyqMeL8CBV63Y) |
| **2011** | TNG (Part 1) | ***Warning*** Explicit lyrics near the end (nothing you probably haven't heard before). I had just finished watching TNG and was working with samples from it. This one is purely for fun and I always enjoyed the comedic undertones in TNG. I thought the rolling bass track came out well and hopefully was aiming for a deep space like sound. There's a TNG part 2 instrumental on one of the Bagan albums which I'd put on par with this one. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/yyheAVMS9oM) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/39IDgLDZ#JVtQzOPSVk8CBDHBrbDh2laga5x7ZilYQ7a_VJv8H5o) |
|  | The End of Time | This combines one of my favourite hip hop tracks by Ugly Duckling with images of the universe and earth. It couldn't have been more wonderful to put together. In Korea, during my first job there, my good computer was in my classroom, so I used to go there at night and edit video and music. I remember staying there all night with this one and not leaving until the sun came up. At the time, I was very concerned with time, rushing through the day mostly and checking the clock constantly because I disliked my work. The weekends were different, mostly for adventures, and found peace and friends there. "Time means nothing: The end of time;" There's a lot there from time being an invention by humans to beliefs of time shifting. It pointed my more unconscious self towards a timeless life in the moment and to embracing impermanence. Two things I didn't start living until years later.   | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/ERZx3MM4g-s) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/D0IWGLZR#NwdKltbBuMR4SB9dGzXHEBdszLSFcEzBpD0JOLrJLeU) |
|  | Bagan's on Your Train | I watched the film North by Northwest (1959) by Alfred Hitchcock and really escaped into it. So much so that I felt compelled to sit down and freestyle about Bagan being the lead. I did the track and later added the visuals. Originally, I said "in the 1960s" and had to re-record later-on to say "in the 1950s" which is technically correct. There are few raps as narratives, and this is one that goes from start to finish. "Climbing down the rocks; getting sweaty socks." is a personal favourite in there. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/WVIUMtubPU8) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/GphmjATJ#B0eUbyDgKMQY2qM7ViGI-T8nkQDu38SFvNUnsNY7ty8) |
| **2012** | Freestyle Akuma | This one highlights my ongoing obsession with playing Ultra SFIV and its predecessors which I've been doing since around 2012. I regularly beat the computer on the hardest difficulty with Akuma. Typically I turn off the game music, leave the SFX on, and put on one of my mixtapes. The flow and sense of mastery that occurs is unmatched. Akuma is a mysterious monk antihero who obsesses over strength, combat, and purity of the martial path harnessing the "dark side" which has corrupted him. I enjoy the nuances of Akuma who somewhat follows a code. Consumed by his path, there is still humanity in him, which makes him relatable. He's more lost than totally gone and is ruthless but calm.  | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/3AnULadwXSQ) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/i9oHSQxT#ZLpd0Uof1rvXfHPlkurW28wG0zRN581KjGeFqzLiGcY) |
|  | Sewer Surfin | This is my tribute to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, my favourite heros growing up, and still to an extent. There was a period in my childhood where watched the first TMNT film every day after kindergarden (72 days - I remember counting) so I've probably watched it well over 100 times (a door into my psyche perhaps). I wanted to capture the different aspects of TMNT from the TV show, to the toys, to the Turtles in Time game, to the movies. Fantasy, adventure, grit, mastery, brotherhood, father/son dynamics, and the list goes on. "Sewer Surfing," sort of says it all about TMNT and how could surfing in the sewer be so awesome? | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/ye7gqa40iIQ) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/f4JVGYiC#Rpxs4s4jNp4ljTAuRLXvfxt0uix9m1CZ7zRrsCZgLbs) |
| **2013** | Shaolin Style | Another Kung Fu shout-out with the 36th Chamber of Shaolin (1978). The film carries Buddhist and Taoist ideas and explores what it is like training to be a Shaolin monk, in a mythical sense, physically, mentally, and spiritually. One aspect that mirrors my own, is that he must learn from a range of masters who provide him with different teachings as he progresses in every category. After he gains a certain level of enlightenment and new perspectives, he is faced with the realities of the world outside the temple and what to do with his new abilities and awareness.   | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/0DNugFlLrBM) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/OlI0FBZa#oFG1P1n8Anq34dT8hTpnNqTDcAjzxkA72TMmVi9NNA0) |
|  | Busan a Lwan ‚Äî Bagan feat. Sai | This one was filmed at my apartment in Busan while I was studying Korean for a semester at Kyongsong University. Sai was a Burmese guy in my class who mentioned he was a rapper so we collaborated. I helped with his vid and he rapped over my track Pleasure Garden. I'm in the video for about a second at the end, falling on the couch for a nap. Since we had no budget, I decided to make it like an old hip hop video which included a run down place, a lot of movement, and fast cuts. Luckily my apartment was on a hill with a cool view. He raps in Burmese except for "mango chicken" for some reason, and drinks a glass of milk which I thought fits how he looks. His song is about sadness and confusion about his girlfriend who he misses, something like this.   | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/1JM42kyxBfQ) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/nwRBjaBQ#XCqeu32zh9YoDdqjGuys2K036EYsHKtOTizZ2uGdk3U) |
|  | Bagan's in the Sea | This is probably the laziest video I ever put together as it is a track from Bagan's first album overtop of the scuba diving sequence from Bright Future (different music there). Jill and I were on the island Ko Tao in Thailand learning how to scuba dive. If you see the pic at the end, there was a running joke with our Norweigan instructor (the guy on right) about the younger German guy (the guy on left) who was late for everything. For one of our dives, the boat was literally leaving and he ran up the dock and leaped on. | [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/2hJFSazD#HuoBgN6eDXgG5IYZT2ZIojqKAr9ZMStdFAyeZLMXi6g) |
| **2014** | Lone Piano (Instrumental) | I'm not a huge anime fan but flurt with it from time to time and enjoy the pure artistry of it and Japanese values and culture beneath it. This video really was an ode to those things and as usual, I wish I had used more high quality footage. I wanted to capture the flow that occurs in different types of fighting sequences across different anime styles, characters, and universes. Musically, this is a track I'm quite proud of and its dynamic and progressive nature, and reveals a dimension of hip hop that is not always explored.  | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/EAjc8oXW8Jw) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/P4pCyBTa#_3wG7ylXYWnPdJSgIKUY-8C5ZaxjLdgl2IAuChuI7dg) |
|  | A Drew Film (Bachelor's Mix) | This is a tribute to my good friend Drew Fontaine, who for his bachelor's party, we went ziplining outside of Winnipeg. I had a sweet camera at the time so thought to document it and maybe turn it into a video. Initial bit is by MC Hammer (my favour track when I was 6) and the main track is by MF Doom - RIP. This one showcases my editing skill more than anything and it was fun making it seem that Drew was ziplining and yelling the background for the majority of the video (the magic of editing - the 1st person footage was from our instructor). I also enjoyed mixing my friends' sounds from that day into the song and playing with the speed and direction of the clips. A fine day and dinner with fine gentlemen it was.   | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/9aQaeqdLwi4) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/mk5DDYTT#TR-KLqPpCmch8YCgvfPtUHOWAkawTKzIP4uFI08qXK4) |
| **2015** | Eyes May Shine | I found the breakdancing footage from Beat Street (1984) and added some underground tracks I like. This was some of the pioneering breakdancing at the time and the atmosphere of that club is timeless in a way. I also liked the different characters from the insecure young guy, to the slick pro guy flipping in, to the women watching, kind of like aunties, and being impressed. The music I put in is from the 1990s and early 2000s so they were probably breaking to different music but I thought there is a surreal timeless quality to it all that seemed to line up. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/KYCCb509xaQ) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/24YzDIBS#6nfOZ4VZJIIyqQjqUeEF4nuzP1NRRzSAo9IuixfDWLM) |
| **2016** | Dark City Trailer (Remix) | Dark City is one of my favourite films. I took a lot of the trailer's cuts and sequences and cut them again using an HD version. The sample in the track is from "The Snowman," an animation about impermenence. The film Dark City is about unconsciousness and levels of awareness at the heart of human behaviour and existence. Aliens aside, it's about being in a dream, waking up, and using awareness towards uncovering the truth and changing the world for the better (hense in the end, we finally see the sunlight and beach). I had to put the project down for a while as I was stuck with a shot selection around around 00:52. Eventually, I settled on them in the boat, which seemed to fit well. I love opposing direction of movements in the shots and actions juxtaposed. Such is the nature of the universe and its pardoxical chaos and order.      | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/9mV3ltzganE) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/WkhFlBaR#xqNNo8gwAOmi0H_PivVO9RRJkfu8TobTUxVIAtaebYM) |
|  | BROOM | This is another one from Beat Street (1984) with some hip hop from Yaggfu Front (1993). What struck me was the unique style of dancing and popping and locking. I admired the innocence of the characters and like a lot of 80s films, it seemed like life was all about having fun, making friends, and being light hearted even in the face of challenges. There's an innocence and authenticity about it all that seems to be missing from today's films. I also thought the guy with the sweater is hilarious so showcased him.  | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/oG8NO84tbZo) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/nhgj2Kgb#6ylBwkxU4XCvE3BJPj1luBMMbibryZP5Q0zESr5dNbg) |
|  | Vampire Iron | The track is a remix from Cannibal Ox and was another lazy one as I came across the video by ROG and the track immediately came to mind. I threw them in my editor and it was one of those moments where everything lined up, almost no editing needed. Even when MF Doom says "a dropping of a diamond," it shows a diamond ring dropping (an editor's dream). I tweaked the ending as it cuts back to the girl looking hopeful for the future with a tear in her eye, one of the great animated shots in my mind. When I originally watched the film, I had a premonition about the rocketship castle behind the black rider in the beginning and end. Shaped the way it was, I would settle down in a place that would have something like this. This happened years before I knew where I was going. It was correct.    | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/piP5OkE2vnI) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/K1g22ShZ#9SFSCb0mvODjqSzu-UXfQQ3v-6I-KurIcMe9KEz7u2g) |
|  | The Smoke | This one is more experimental with one of Bagan's rap tracks over it. The intention was to capture what it might be like before one dies, with memories and images flashing before our eyes. It's a reflection on a spiritual journey that often feels like it is through the smoke and shadows with light permeating in the background. At the time, I was backpacking Indonesia and would have a spiced cigarette before bed (hence "the Smoke"). This one was produced in a hotel room in Bali on my laptop. There were some chairs outside the door to sit and watch the night and courtyard.    | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/7i_sArtHv6Y) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/e9RF2biD#7buAfS7SGY_Z7CQtFtqFv4zKIpaiDAJQpta78P7Gk5I) |
| **2017** | Light / Dark | This one is a song I wrote on guitar and played with a drummer and bass player. The film is Ninja Scrolls (1993). While I lived in Toronto, I dabbled with getting a band together and jammed with a drummer, James, for around a year or so. We had 5 or so songs, and held auditions for singers but nothing clicked into place. The whole thing sort of summed up my time in Toronto, dabbling with little vision or motivation. Maybe the timing was off as well as my songwriting was at a lower level and no one came along to really spark it or to collaborate with. Even though I was around other artists and musicians, everyone seemed to be on a different planet with what they liked and wanted to do. A dead end there for me in many sense, which is why I left. The song at the end was from a popular animation at the time called Cybersix. Also, on a mystical note, the bassist, Lucas disappeared into mosh pit at a metal concert in the middle of the night, and we never saw him again after that (he received our texts but didn't reply). | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/Lknm0PgsOo4) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/WsA1TDpJ#XkvUNEwYWLEVr-AEcGuhq1axnGYsXdt52AcPGDaNruQ) |
| **2025** | Seaside Piano | This is from a recent journey to Taitung in 2024. It was one of those places near the seaside to relax and take photos.  I thought the piano was cool so Donna got the video. I then proceeded to accidently break one of 3 tire swings nearby (ouch!). The challenge editing was finding a song that matched how I was moving and sliding my hands. After searching Stevie Wonder and rock piano solos, I found a track from a video game that did the trick. Fun fact with how Youtube works: this one got 1.4k views in just 9 days; over 1k views faster than some of my vids from 17 years ago! The power of concept, relevance, presentation, and copy I suppose. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtube.com/shorts/xejFGhKlu1E) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/ekwREJ4C#dsbLLzkobQDgS5n7LbgDBWEyCPhMNo8-ClOitoggEOY) |
|  | Wedding Day | ***Warning*** Some explicit lyrics in there (not many). This was Donna and I's marriage registration day which we keep off YouTube for privacy reasons. The track is one of my all time favourites: Recognize Realize Part 2 -Mobb Deep- produced by Havoc. There's nothing like Mobb Deep's sound with some gem tracks and remixes out there. I found some anime that resembled Kaohsiung, the twilight and dreamy atmosphere, and Donna, so it all came together. The video reminds me about how awesome the registration day was and how we went from the government office, to a brunch, to a walk around the island, to a rib dinner on the beach. It was very casual to say the least. The day also represents  culmination of several of my dreams coming to fruitition and is a reminder of the gift of Donna and the many joys in my life I get to live out each day.  | [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/etZlmCiR#Zyd3-pf3nQrov-uY3WIELUwgu6-VLILYC1gCZZscnhc) |
