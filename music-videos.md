# üé• Music Video Archive

Welcome to my music video collection ‚Äî a personal timeline of experimental edits, animated sequences, and collaborative works that span nearly two decades. These projects were driven by inspiration, experimentation, and often built from scratch using editing software, game engines, animation tools, or remixing found footage. 

Some are standalone visual pieces; others accompany mixtape tracks or narrative ideas. They each reflect a creative moment in time ‚Äî sometimes spontaneous, sometimes meticulously crafted. No matter the approach, these videos represent my evolving visual language and editing style.

These are purely for fun and for a love of editing. As you can tell, I'm not a visual artist by any means; however, there is joy to mixing together different content and creating something.

| **2007** | Matt Renaud Dis | This was shot in the summer of 2007 in Winnipeg. My buddies Matt and Drew travelled Europe recently and there were some hilarious email stories. It is one of the first tracks I produced from scratch and rapped over. One does not know for sure if "Matt Renaud ain't got no flow" but you better watch the video and find out. . | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/MFJAHjia1NM) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/nhAG3QgS#zQZ0W4ChNMn3FpWaJuBAhlbh-LMJMkgoR5O-Hq-7Rlo) |
|  | Too Graphic \| Bagan feat. Bert McKinley | This was produced for a class at Ryerson, digital media or something which is not my forte. Bert and I teamed up and I did the track in 1 night with 2 vocal versions, all freestyled. Bert picked this version which lended itself to visuals better. It got a laugh from the class and got around to my colleagues for about a week or so. The best was Bert (who laughs like Beastly from Care Bears) quoting it randomly for the next few years. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/-nq6KfBSDaA) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/j0Yi0Q4T#qXEn75r6Vp2_5I3pjYTsck0LgA7cQugJvPTGS5pRZvg) |
| **2008** | Emporer in Japan | I was into watching Akira Kurasawa films at that time I found a trailor for Ran 1985 and was inspired to freestyle a rhyme about being the emporer, in a state of delussion in a sense while my kingdom is obviously falling. Notice it's "in Japan" not "of Japan," which points to the fleeting and limited power of such leaders in reality. The film itself is a visual classic and operaic in a lot of ways. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/eiC_HMy8WIQ) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/LspG0B6A#z209zbtNdD6oe2MRcZ-bheZqD_H7q6_6Rdw5pZRcLtk) |
|  | Machinima in Bagan's Tub | This was done for a class at Ryerson. The course desription said it included how to use a greenscreen, the reason I took the course, which the professor completely ignored. There was no green screen work. Since I was determined to use a greenscreen, this is the best I could come up with. I think I got a B or B+, got a laugh from the class, and made some new friends in the process.  One of my favourites from this collection. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/IA38pTEJ0gI) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/2lI1FZoa#4Pm4NLuo_WOluA5tS-AZDFFfgWoDywBwfiZa_VvCCog) |
| **2010** | Sniper Challengers (on Bald Mountain) | ***Warning*** explicit lyrics in this one from the start. Done at my shared flat near "Hooker Harveys" in Toronto, there was something so raw and dark about the track that lended itself to the film's visuals that were originally paired with the Night on Bald Mountain by Modest Mussorgsky. I watched the Fantasia sequence growing up so I knew the sample. Watching it right to the end, which I kept from the film, is quite worth it, even if the music is soft. There is a surreal sense of having witnessed a dream or a hidden side to things and light gradually appearing, putting it back in its place. It also points to an era of Disney where its work was more conceptual and evocative.    | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/a_jE38hMkq0) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/jgojCKgJ#QltrDj0FVx-ge_ciTDUcFaywgS9sO5DZ6Y_2UPpZv5k) |
|  | Godzilla vs. Bagan | I did this one in Winnipeg while staying with my mom at her apartment across from Grant Park. I noticed there was a character named Bagan that fights Godzilla, so searched and found the visuals originally from a NES game. I was impressed by the imagination of the visual style. Even with graphics that are unimpressive by today's standards, they were able to draw me in and to suspend my disbelief. I also love the idea of two giant monsters meeting on a "dark stormy night" to brawl it out in the depths of a city. The beat was one of my first with a drum machine and midi keyboard. Apart from the SFX, there was no samples used.| [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/zDveF7Zvw3s) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/nxBnGCDS#tfJZZmFzlw6BsygQL1B9CGzMaV3rCPGLVE0ncYBDOs8) |
|  | MAGNIFICENT | This was from a time in Toronto when I was watching a lot of famous Kung Fu films. This scene, from the Magnificent Butcher 1979, caught my eye as the master in blue has a particular grace and zenlike quality to his movements. The track was on a playlist I was listening to at the time which also has the sort of feeling beneath it. Due to the availability of the film at the time, the quality is what it is. A lot of the footage I needed to speed up as the actual movements in the film were quite slow. The ending loops back to repeat footage already shown. I think in addition to pointing to looping in hip hop itself, gives a sense of these two masters (one good, one evil) eternally battling it out, trying to out-wit one another.  | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/cnnnGOFf8uo) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/PxomnAzI#AoxkSwwhOdxOl8DzhGjvIoDr3pPAfEbyqMeL8CBV63Y) |
