# üé• Music Video Archive

Welcome to my music video collection ‚Äî a personal timeline of experimental edits, animated sequences, and collaborative works that span nearly two decades. These projects were driven by inspiration, experimentation, and often built from scratch using editing software, game engines, animation tools, or remixing found footage. 

Some are standalone visual pieces; others accompany mixtape tracks or narrative ideas. They each reflect a creative moment in time ‚Äî sometimes spontaneous, sometimes meticulously crafted. 

These are purely for fun and for a love of editing. As you can tell, I'm not a visual artist by any means; however, there is joy to mixing together different content and like a good cup of coffee, watching it bloom.

| **2007** | Matt Renaud Dis | This was shot in the summer of 2007 in Winnipeg. Matt and Drew travelled Europe and there were some hilarious email stories they sent me. It is one of the first tracks Bagan produced from scratch and rapped over. One does not know for sure if "Matt Renaud ain't got no flow" but you better watch the video and find out. . | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/MFJAHjia1NM) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/nhAG3QgS#zQZ0W4ChNMn3FpWaJuBAhlbh-LMJMkgoR5O-Hq-7Rlo) |
|  | Too Graphic \| Bagan feat. Bert McKinley | This was produced for a class at Ryerson. Bert and I teamed up and I did the track in one night with two vocal versions, all freestyled. Bert picked this version which lended itself to the visual style he had in mind. It got a laugh from the class and word went around in the faculty. The best part of it all was Bert quoting it randomly for the next few years. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/-nq6KfBSDaA) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/j0Yi0Q4T#qXEn75r6Vp2_5I3pjYTsck0LgA7cQugJvPTGS5pRZvg) |
| **2008** | Emporer in Japan | I was into watching Akira Kurasawa films and found a trailor for Ran 1985. Comedy aside, the contrast between the lyrics and visuals, points to the delussion states that are apparent when reigns and kingdoms are falling. The film itself is a visual masterpiece and operaic in a lot of ways - set in a distant time, in a realm of fantasy in many ways. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/eiC_HMy8WIQ) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/LspG0B6A#z209zbtNdD6oe2MRcZ-bheZqD_H7q6_6Rdw5pZRcLtk) |
|  | Machinima in Bagan's Tub | This was done for a class at Ryerson. The course desription said the class would instruct us on how to use a green screen, which the professor completely ignored. Since I was determined to use a green screen, I came up with this which Bert helped me film. I got a B, a laugh from the class, and made some new friends in the process. It is one of my creative favourites. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/IA38pTEJ0gI) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/2lI1FZoa#4Pm4NLuo_WOluA5tS-AZDFFfgWoDywBwfiZa_VvCCog) |
| **2010** | Sniper Challengers (on Bald Mountain) | ***Warning*** explicit lyrics from the start. Done at my shared flat in Toronto near "Hooker Harveys," I knew the sample from watching Fantasia growing up. Pairing it with the track by 9th Prince was a turn-key. The chaotic darkness contrasts with the harmony of dawn at the end where there is a surreal sense of having witnessed a dream. More conceptual and evocative that lost era of Disney was. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/a_jE38hMkq0) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/jgojCKgJ#QltrDj0FVx-ge_ciTDUcFaywgS9sO5DZ6Y_2UPpZv5k) |
|  | Godzilla vs. Bagan | I did this one in Winnipeg while staying at my mom's apartment across from Grant Park. I noticed there was a character named Bagan that fights Godzilla. When I found the footage from the NES game, I was impressed by the visual style which was able to draw me in. The concept of two giant monsters meeting on a "dark stormy night" to brawl it out in the depths of a city is something I'll always love. The beat was one of my first with a drum machine and midi keyboard. Apart from the Godzilla SFX, there were no samples used.| [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/zDveF7Zvw3s) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/nxBnGCDS#tfJZZmFzlw6BsygQL1B9CGzMaV3rCPGLVE0ncYBDOs8) |
|  | MAGNIFICENT | This was from a time in Toronto when I was watching a lot of famous Kung Fu films. This scene from the Magnificent Butcher 1979, caught my eye as the master in blue has particular grace. A lot of the footage and movements I needed to speed up. The ending gives the sense that the two masters are in an eternal battle trying to out-wit one another. It is also nod to looping in hip hop.  | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/cnnnGOFf8uo) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/PxomnAzI#AoxkSwwhOdxOl8DzhGjvIoDr3pPAfEbyqMeL8CBV63Y) |
| **2011** | TNG (Part 1) | ***Warning*** Explicit lyrics near the end. I had just finished watching TNG the series and was working with samples from it. This one is purely for fun and I always enjoyed the comedic undertones in TNG. The rolling bass and the deep space soundscape came out well. If you liked this one, TNG part 2 instrumental on Bagan the Next Generation is available. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/yyheAVMS9oM) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/39IDgLDZ#JVtQzOPSVk8CBDHBrbDh2laga5x7ZilYQ7a_VJv8H5o) |
|  | The End of Time | This combines one of my favourite tracks by Ugly Duckling with images of the universe and earth. During my first teaching job in Korea, my personal PC was in my classroom, so I used to go there at night and edit video and music. With this one, I didn't leave until the sun came up. In my life at the time, I was very concerned with time, rushing through the day mostly, and checking the clock constantly because I disliked my exhausting work (such a poor way to live really). The weekends were different, mostly for adventures, and found peace and friends there. "Time means nothing: The end of time." | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/ERZx3MM4g-s) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/D0IWGLZR#NwdKltbBuMR4SB9dGzXHEBdszLSFcEzBpD0JOLrJLeU) |
|  | Bagan's on Your Train | I watched the film North by Northwest (1959) by Alfred Hitchcock and felt compelled to sit down and freestyle about Bagan being the main character. I did the track and later added the visuals. Originally, I said "in the 1960s" and had to re-record it months later to say "in the 1950s" which is correct. This is a rap with a narrative that goes from start to finish. "Climbing down the rocks; getting sweaty socks," is a personal favourite in there. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/WVIUMtubPU8) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/GphmjATJ#B0eUbyDgKMQY2qM7ViGI-T8nkQDu38SFvNUnsNY7ty8) |
| **2012** | Freestyle Akuma | This one highlights my ongoing obsession with playing Ultra SFIV and its predecessors which I've been doing since childhood. In Ultra SFIV, my current go-to, I regularly beat the computer on the hardest difficulty. Typically I turn off the game music, leave the SFX on, and put on one of my mixtapes. The sense of mastery I feel and the flow that occurs is unmatched. I enjoy the nuances of Akuma who is a mysterious monk antihero who obsesses over strength, combat, and purity. Consumed by his path on the "dark side", there is still humanity in him, which makes him relatable. He's more of a lost soul; ruthless but calm and calculated.   | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/3AnULadwXSQ) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/i9oHSQxT#ZLpd0Uof1rvXfHPlkurW28wG0zRN581KjGeFqzLiGcY) |
|  | Sewer Surfin | This is my tribute to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, my favourite heros growing up. There was a time where I watched the first TMNT film every day after kindergarden for 72 days in a row (I remember counting for fun). I've probably watched the film well over 100 times (perhaps a door into my psyche). I wanted to capture the different aspects of TMNT from the TV show, to the toys, to the Turtles in Time game, to the movies. Fantasy, adventure, grit, mastery, brotherhood, and father/son dynamics are some of the themes it explores. "Sewer Surfing," sort of says it all about TMNT. How could surfing in the sewer be so awesome?| [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/ye7gqa40iIQ) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/f4JVGYiC#Rpxs4s4jNp4ljTAuRLXvfxt0uix9m1CZ7zRrsCZgLbs) |
| **2013** | Shaolin Style | Another Kung Fu shout-out with the 36th Chamber of Shaolin (1978). The film carries Buddhist and Taoist undertones and explores what it is like training to be a Shaolin monk, in a mythical sense, physically, mentally, and spiritually. The main guy (played by Gordon Liu) must learn from a range of masters who provide him with different teachings as he progresses in every category. After he gains a certain level of enlightenment and new perspectives, he is faced with the realities of the world outside the temple and what to do with himself.  | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/0DNugFlLrBM) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/OlI0FBZa#oFG1P1n8Anq34dT8hTpnNqTDcAjzxkA72TMmVi9NNA0) |
|  | Busan a Lwan ‚Äî Bagan feat. Sai | I was studying Korean for a semester at Kyongsong University and Sai was a Burmese guy in my class there. I helped with his vid and he rapped over my track Pleasure Garden. I'm in the video for about a second at the end, falling on the couch for a nap. Since we had no budget, I decided to make it like an old hip hop video which included a run down place and a lot of camera movement and fast cuts. Luckily my apartment was on a hill with a cool view of the city. He raps in Burmese except for "mango chicken," for some reason, and drinks a glass of milk which I thought fits how he looks. His rap is about his sadness and confusion about his girlfriend whom he misses. Fun Fact: That apartment was demolished shortly after I moved. I once asked the landlord, a black American guy, who lived on the floor below if we could take sledge hammers and have fun smashing things. He had the deepest voice I ever heard and said, "No way man. Nooooo way."  | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/1JM42kyxBfQ) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/nwRBjaBQ#XCqeu32zh9YoDdqjGuys2K036EYsHKtOTizZ2uGdk3U) |
|  | Bagan's in the Sea | This is probably the laziest video I ever put together as it is one of Bagan's tracks overtop of a sequence I already had. Jill and I were on the island Ko Tao in Thailand learning how to scuba dive. If you see the pic at the end, there was a running joke with our Norweigan instructor (the guy on right) about the younger German guy (the guy on left) who was late for everything (Germans are notoriously known for being punctual). For one of our dives, the boat was literally leaving and he ran up the dock, half dressed, and leapt on. | [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/2hJFSazD#HuoBgN6eDXgG5IYZT2ZIojqKAr9ZMStdFAyeZLMXi6g) |
| **2014** | Lone Piano (Instrumental) | This one is an ode to fighting in anime. I wanted to capture the flow that occurs in different types of fighting sequences across different anime styles, characters, and universes. Musically, this is a track I'm quite proud of and its progressive dimension.  | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/EAjc8oXW8Jw) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/P4pCyBTa#_3wG7ylXYWnPdJSgIKUY-8C5ZaxjLdgl2IAuChuI7dg) |
|  | A Drew Film (Bachelor's Mix) | This is a tribute to my good friend Drew Fontaine, who for his bachelor's party, we went ziplining near Winnipeg. I had a sweet camera at the time so thought to document it and maybe turn it into a video. This one showcases my editing skill more than anything. It was fun making it seem like Drew was ziplining and yelling in the background for the majority of it. I also enjoyed mixing my friends' sounds and playing with the speed and direction of the clips. T'was a fine day with fine gentlemen.   | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/9aQaeqdLwi4) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/mk5DDYTT#TR-KLqPpCmch8YCgvfPtUHOWAkawTKzIP4uFI08qXK4) |
| **2015** | Eyes May Shine | I found the breakdancing footage from Beat Street (1984) and added some underground tracks I like. The atmosphere of that club is timeless and admire the different characters that appear. They were probably breaking to different music but I thought there is a surreal quality to it all that seemed to line up. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/KYCCb509xaQ) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/24YzDIBS#6nfOZ4VZJIIyqQjqUeEF4nuzP1NRRzSAo9IuixfDWLM) |
| **2016** | Dark City Trailer (Remix) | I took a lot of Dark City's trailer's sequences and cut them again using an HD version. The sample in the track is from "The Snowman," a Christmas animation from the 1980s which I used to play for my kids in Korea. The film Dark City is about being in a dream, waking up, uncovering the truth, and changing the world. I had to put the project down for a while as I was stuck with a shot selection around around 00:52. Eventually, I settled on them in a boat. The opposing directions juxtaposed is a nod to the paradoxes explored.      | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/9mV3ltzganE) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/WkhFlBaR#xqNNo8gwAOmi0H_PivVO9RRJkfu8TobTUxVIAtaebYM) |
|  | BROOM | This is another one from Beat Street (1984) with some hip hop from Yaggfu Front (1993). What struck me was the unique style of dancing in the film and the innocence of the characters. Like a lot of 80s pictures, Beat Street emphasizes having fun, making friends, and being light hearted in the face of challenges - an innocence and authenticity that seems to be missing from today's films. I also showcased the guy with the sweater who is hilarious.  | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/oG8NO84tbZo) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/nhgj2Kgb#6ylBwkxU4XCvE3BJPj1luBMMbibryZP5Q0zESr5dNbg) |
|  | Vampire Iron | It was one of those moments where a hip hop track and a pre-edited video I found lined up, almost no editing needed from me. When MF Doom says, "a dropping of a diamond," it shows a diamond ring dropping (an editor's dream). The beginning and ending are a close up of a girl with a single tear, one of the great animated shots in my mind. When I originally watched the film, I had a premonition about the rocketship castle and that I would settle down in a place that would have something like this. It was correct.    | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/piP5OkE2vnI) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/K1g22ShZ#9SFSCb0mvODjqSzu-UXfQQ3v-6I-KurIcMe9KEz7u2g) |
|  | The Smoke | This one is more experimental. The intention was to capture what it might be like before we die, with memories and images flashing before our eyes. It's a reflection on living that often feels like it is through smoke with light permeating in the background. I produced the music and recorded the vocals in a hotel room in Bali. At the time, I was backpacking Indonesia and before bed would relax with a local spiced cigarette. There were deck chairs outside my door and I'd sit and watch the night and courtyard. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/7i_sArtHv6Y) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/e9RF2biD#7buAfS7SGY_Z7CQtFtqFv4zKIpaiDAJQpta78P7Gk5I) |
| **2017** | Light / Dark | The film is Ninja Scrolls (1993). I remembered the blind swordsman in the forest from a Youtube video that used to be up, and mimicked the sequence from that one. The instrumental is a song I composed and played with drummer James and bass player Lucas while I lived in Toronto. I dabbled with getting a band together and jammed with James for around a year on and off. We held auditions for singers but none clicked. The bassist, Lucas, disappeared into mosh pit at a metal concert in the middle of the night, and we never saw him again after that (he received our texts but didn't reply). The song at the end is by Canadian artists and is from an animation called Cybersix. The time in Toronto was a significant time in my life of dabbling and revisiting the past but ultimately a dead end in terms of staying there. | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtu.be/Lknm0PgsOo4) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/WsA1TDpJ#XkvUNEwYWLEVr-AEcGuhq1axnGYsXdt52AcPGDaNruQ) |
| **2025** | Seaside Piano | This is from a recent journey to Taitung in 2024. It was one of those places near the seaside to relax and take photos.  I thought the piano was cool so Donna got the video. I proceeded to accidently break one of 3 tire swings nearby (ouch!). Finding a piano song that matched how I was dancing and sliding my hands was the challenge. After searching Stevie Wonder and rock piano solos, I found a track from a video game that did the trick. Fun fact about how Youtube works: this one got 1.4k views in just 9 days; over 1k views faster than some of my vids from 17 years ago! | [‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube](https://youtube.com/shorts/xejFGhKlu1E) <br> [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/ekwREJ4C#dsbLLzkobQDgS5n7LbgDBWEyCPhMNo8-ClOitoggEOY) |
|  | Wedding Day | ***Warning*** Some explicit lyrics in there (not many). This was Donna and I's marriage registration day which for privacy reasons is not on YouTube. The track is one of my all time favourites: Recognize Realize Part 2 -Mobb Deep- produced by Havoc. I found some anime clips that resembled Kaohsiung, the twilight and dreamy atmosphere, and Donna, so it all came together. The video reminds me about how awesome the day was and how we went from the government office, to a brunch, to a walk around Cijin island, to a rib dinner on the beach. It was very casual and just for us. It also celebrated a culmination of my dreams coming to fruitition. It is a reminder of the gift of life, Donna, and the many joys I get to live out each day.  | [üì• MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/etZlmCiR#Zyd3-pf3nQrov-uY3WIELUwgu6-VLILYC1gCZZscnhc) |
