## 🎬 Main Shorts Collection

| Title | Description | Link(s) |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Canada – 2019.mp4** | Unedited clips of my trip to Halifax, NS in 2019. This is to remind me of the realities of Canadian winter and city planning more than anything. | <a href="https://mega.nz/file/GwoXwSJC#1qi8uYc7lCp9RNosTnwsFRRvd1wRQFOmm89zRacITx4" target="_blank">🔗 MEGA</a> |
| **Justin’s Awesome Golf Game** | This is from a version of Hot Shots Golf that I played either on my laptop or PS3 back in the day. You could replay the final shot as many times as you'd like.  | <a href="https://mega.nz/file/nlpCiK6I#kfMSkp_SjoGepznjzweDAb-CPyYvF2Nwyb6JOzAlZf8" target="_blank">🔗 MEGA</a> |
| **MK BEAR – Moving Face** | This is for Alex Edye who has always been facinated and mezmerized by this picture. He typically asks, "is that even possible?" The track is from Bagan Air and is about Mortal Kombat Trilogy.  | <a href="https://mega.nz/file/z9JRUBZT#b5gykxNrj9sGbJcWZc2cLiJXhe9tfIt67LkreCgprFU" target="_blank">🔗 MEGA</a> |
| **Star2.mp4** | This was a trial of concept I had. I never got around to finishing the video.| <a href="https://mega.nz/file/X9RWQCTb#powm_8DLZ9ka_AYGWgjY3Yrr5K3Rn4aqr_Gstat1Q6Y" target="_blank">🔗 MEGA</a> |
| **Tuxedo FINAL** | This one goes on for way too long and you can probably stop watching after 10 seconds. | <a href="https://mega.nz/file/SogFgTzC#T1yiOyUyZysdma7-2ArhYbEfaErx8L9blJPSMymS5mk" target="_blank">🔗 MEGA</a> |
| **Santa’s Message to Justin** | One Christmas I thought it was funny to send personalized Santa videos to all my friends and family. I imagine they must have had to film Santa for days to get every common name.| <a href="https://mega.nz/file/e4xVQQpA#YURHI0-gviQQGDkcijqhzhVpVSs3w5w8C_f6_2-j64U" target="_blank">🔗 MEGA</a> |
| **Taiwan Pineapple Remix** | This was at a friend's picnic at Central Park in Kaohsiung (2018). For a period of time, I used to bring a pineapple to picnics for people and slice it up right there. | <a href="https://youtu.be/tOgejAjO-qc" target="_blank">🎥 YouTube</a><br><a href="https://mega.nz/file/OlwCgQ5S#KZa-28nxQZuL1gN0lJ-zNJa3GApMKmwy5F6KfS1Hmc0" target="_blank">🔗 MEGA</a> |

## 📦 Bonus Archive

| **Library Guy** | These were created in the fall of 2022 in Cranbrook after visiting my friends in Winnipeg. For some reason, Matt kept making librarian jokes when we'd cruise around. I'm pretty sure he stopped his car in the middle of the road at the forks to yell out the window at a library co-worker. The dots connected after we got those pics. I meant to release these sooner but kept putting it off. | <a href="https://mega.nz/folder/WhxwxR4b#QV89VODewUZOlVSFWuSoCw" target="_blank">🔗 MEGA Folder</a> |
