# 🎞️ Random Shorts

Welcome to the Random Shorts archive — a personal, eclectic collection of short videos, animations, remixes, and random one-offs. These were made purely for fun, creativity, or testing ideas. They range from silly to surreal, personal to absurd.

There’s no schedule or structure here. Some were made in a few hours, others over many days. They span different years and styles — all united by the spirit of play and experimentation.

To experience the shorts:

- Click the **🔗 Link** next to each title to stream or download.
- All links open in a new tab so you stay on the archive page.

> 🎥 **Note:** Some files are hosted via MEGA. You can stream them in-browser or download them directly (no account needed).

## 🎬 Main Shorts Collection

| Title | Description | Link(s) |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Canada – 2019.mp4** | Unedited clips of my trip to Halifax, NS in 2019. This is to remind me of the realities of Canadian winter and city planning more than anything. | <a href="https://mega.nz/file/GwoXwSJC#1qi8uYc7lCp9RNosTnwsFRRvd1wRQFOmm89zRacITx4" target="_blank">🔗 MEGA</a> |
| **Justin’s Awesome Golf Game** | This is from a version of Hot Shots Golf that I played either on my laptop or PS3 back in the day. You could replay the final shot as many times as you'd like.  | <a href="https://mega.nz/file/nlpCiK6I#kfMSkp_SjoGepznjzweDAb-CPyYvF2Nwyb6JOzAlZf8" target="_blank">🔗 MEGA</a> |
| **MK BEAR – Moving Face** | This is for Alex Edye who has always been facinated and mezmerized by this picture and how I arranged my face like this. He typically asks "is that even possible?" The track is from Bagan Air and is about Mortal Kombat.  | <a href="https://mega.nz/file/z9JRUBZT#b5gykxNrj9sGbJcWZc2cLiJXhe9tfIt67LkreCgprFU" target="_blank">🔗 MEGA</a> |
| **Star2.mp4** | This was a trial of concept I had and never got around to finishing the video. | <a href="https://mega.nz/file/X9RWQCTb#powm_8DLZ9ka_AYGWgjY3Yrr5K3Rn4aqr_Gstat1Q6Y" target="_blank">🔗 MEGA</a> |
| **Tuxedo FINAL** | This one goes on for way too long and you can probably stop watching after about 10 seconds. | <a href="https://mega.nz/file/SogFgTzC#T1yiOyUyZysdma7-2ArhYbEfaErx8L9blJPSMymS5mk" target="_blank">🔗 MEGA</a> |
| **Santa’s Message to Justin** | One Christmas I thought it was funny to arrange videos like this for all my friends and family. I imagine Santa there must have had to film for days to get every common English name.| <a href="https://mega.nz/file/e4xVQQpA#YURHI0-gviQQGDkcijqhzhVpVSs3w5w8C_f6_2-j64U" target="_blank">🔗 MEGA</a> |
| **Taiwan Pineapple Remix** | My friend took this of me while at a picnic at Central Park in Kaohsiung. 2018-2019, sometime in there. For a period of time, I used to bring a whole pineapple to picnics and slice it up right there | <a href="https://youtu.be/tOgejAjO-qc" target="_blank">🎥 YouTube</a><br><a href="https://mega.nz/file/OlwCgQ5S#KZa-28nxQZuL1gN0lJ-zNJa3GApMKmwy5F6KfS1Hmc0" target="_blank">🔗 MEGA</a> |

| **Library Guy** | I made these in fall 2022 in Cranbrook after visiting my friends in Winnipeg for the summer. Matt kept making librarian jokes similar to these as we cruised around. I'm pretty sure he stopped his car at the forks to yell out the window at a co-worker. Hopefully they are not too offensive and I was kind of lazy to release these. | <a href="https://mega.nz/folder/WhxwxR4b#QV89VODewUZOlVSFWuSoCw" target="_blank">🔗 MEGA Folder</a> |
