# ðŸ”¥ Gen 1 Mixtapes (2000â€“2010)

This is the raw zone â€” my earliest experiments in cutting and blending tracks. Less editing, more instinct. These reflect early attempts at mood and vibe before I had a refined process. There are no individual mixtape descriptions here â€” just the pure archive.

To experience the tapes:

- Click the **Download** link beside each era.
- Open the desired mixtape folder. 
- Preview each track with Mega's player.  
- Click the "Download" button at the top for the complete mixtape .zip.
- Right-click specific files and follow the options to download.
